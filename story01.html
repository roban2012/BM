A History of the World in 100 Objects was a joint project of BBC Radio 4 and the British Museum, comprising a 100-part radio series written and presented by British Museum director Neil MacGregor. In 15-minute presentations broadcast on weekdays on Radio 4, MacGregor used objects of ancient art, industry, technology and arms, all of which are in the British Museum's collections, as an introduction to parts of human history. The series, four years in planning, began on 18 January 2010 and was broadcast over 20 weeks.[1] A book to accompany the series, A History of the World in 100 Objects by Neil MacGregor, was published by Allen Lane on 28 October 2010.[2] The entire series is also available for download along with an audio version of the book for purchase. The British Museum won the 2011 Art Fund Prize for its role in hosting the project.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Neil MacGregor</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Robert Neil MacGregor, OM, AO, FSA (born 16 June 1946) is a British art historian and museum director. He was the Editor of the Burlington Magazine from 1981 to 1987, the Director of the National Gallery, London, from 1987 to 2002, and was appointed Director of the British Museum in 2002. He has presented three television series on art and the BBC Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 Objects, which aired in 2010 and later became a best-selling book.
<br><br>
Neil MacGregor was born in Glasgow to two doctors, Alexander and Anna MacGregor. At the age of nine, he first saw Salvador Dalí's Christ of Saint John of the Cross, newly acquired by Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery, which had a profound effect on him and sparked his lifelong interest in art. MacGregor was educated at Glasgow Academy and then read modern languages at New College, Oxford, where he is now an honorary fellow.
<br><br>
The period that followed was spent studying philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris (coinciding with the events of May 1968), and as a law student at Edinburgh University, where he received the Green Prize. Despite being called to the bar in 1972, MacGregor next decided to take an art history degree. The following year, on a Courtauld Institute (University of London) summer school in Bavaria, the Courtauld's director Anthony Blunt spotted MacGregor and persuaded him to take a master's degree under his supervision.[2] Blunt later considered MacGregor "the most brilliant pupil he ever taught".[3]<br><br>

From 1975 to 1981, MacGregor taught History of Art and Architecture at the University of Reading. He left to assume the editorship of The Burlington Magazine. He oversaw the transfer of the magazine from the Thomson Corporation to an independent and charitable status.
<br><br>




Directorship of the National Gallery <br><br>

In 1987 MacGregor became a highly successful director of the National Gallery in London. There he was dubbed "Saint Neil", partly because of his popularity at that institution and partly because of his devout Christianity, and the nickname stuck after his departure from the Gallery. During his directorship, MacGregor presented three BBC television series on art: Painting the World in 1995, Making Masterpieces, a behind-the-scenes tour of the National Gallery, in 1997 and Seeing Salvation, on the representation of Jesus in western art, in 2000. He declined the offer of a knighthood in 1999, the first director of the National Gallery to do so.[5]<br><br>


Directorship of the British Museum <br><br>

MacGregor was made director of the British Museum in August 2002, at a time when that institution was pounds5 million in deficit. He has been lauded for his "diplomatic" approach to the post, though MacGregor rejects this description, stating that "diplomat is conventionally taken to mean the promotion of the interests of a particular state and that is not what we are about at all".[5] Holding his office during a period which has seen the Acropolis Museum constructed in Athens, he has consistently argued against returning the British Museum's sculptures from the Parthenon (the "Elgin Marbles") to Greece. He has stated that it is the British Museum's duty to "preserve the universality of the marbles, and to protect them from being appropriated as a nationalistic political symbol"[6] and that "there is no legal system in Europe that would challenge the [British Museum's] legal title" to the works.[7]
<br><br>

In January 2008, MacGregor was appointed chairman of the World Collections programme, for training international curators at British museums.[8] The exhibition The First Emperor, focussing on Qin Shi Huang and including a small number of his Terracotta Warriors, was mounted in 2008 in the British Museum Reading Room. That year MacGregor was invited to succeed Philippe de Montebello as the Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He declined the offer as the Metropolitan charges its visitors for entry and is thus "not a public institution".[5]
<br><br>
In 2010, MacGregor presented a series on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service entitled A History of the World in 100 Objects, based on objects from the British Museum's collection. From September 2010 to January 2011 the British Museum lent the ancient Persian Cyrus Cylinder to an exhibition in Tehran. This was seen by at least a million visitors by the Museum's estimation, more than any loan exhibition to the United Kingdom had attracted since the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition in 1972.[9] On 4 November 2010 MacGregor was appointed to the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II.[10] On 25 March 2013 MacGregor was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) by the Governor General of Australia Quentin Bryce. Shakespeare's Restless World was published in 2013.

<br><br>

Media projects <br><br>

MacGregor has made many programmes for British television and radio. In the year 2000, he presented on television Seeing Salvation, about how Jesus had been depicted in famous paintings. More recently, he has made important contributions on BBC Radio Four, including A History of the World in 100 Objects and, in 2012, a series of fifteen-minute programmes after The World at One called Shakespeare's Restless World, discussing themes in the plays of William Shakespeare.[11]
<br><br>
At the end of September 2014 UK domestic transmission started of his similarly formatted Talk Radio series Germany: Memories of a Nation.

The programme series, described as "a landmark project",[3] is billed as 'A history of humanity' told through a hundred objects from all over the world in the British Museum's collection.
<br><br>

In these programmes, I'm travelling back in time, and across the globe, to see how we humans over 2 million years have shaped our world and been shaped by it, and I'm going to tell this story exclusively through the things that humans have made: all sorts of things, carefully designed, and then either admired and preserved, or used, broken and thrown away. I've chosen just a hundred objects from different points on our journey, from a cooking pot to a golden galleon, from a Stone Age tool to a credit card.[4]
<br><br>

Telling history through things, whether it's an Egyptian mummy or a credit card, is what museums are for, and because the British Museum has collected things from all over the globe, it's not a bad place to try to tell a world history. Of course, it can only be "a" history of the world, not "the" history. When people come to the museum they choose their own objects and make their own journey round the world and through time, but I think what they will find is that their own histories quickly intersect with everybody elses, and when that happens, you no longer have a history of a particular people or nation, but a story of endless connections.[5]

Accompanying the series is a website, described by The Guardian as "even more ambitious [than the radio series itself] that encourages users to submit items of their own for a place in world history", along with much interactive content, detailed information on all the objects featured in the radio programmes and links to 350 other museum collections across the UK.[6] The radio programmes will be available on the website permanently for listening or downloading.
<br><br>
The museum has adapted exhibitions for the series by including additional easily identifiable plaques for the 100 objects with text based on the programme and adding a section to the gallery maps showing the location and numbers of the 100 objects.
<br><br>
On 18 January 2010, an hour-long special of The Culture Show on BBC2 was dedicated to the launch of the project.[7]
<br><br>
The first part of the series was broadcast on weekdays over six weeks between 18 January and 26 February 2010. After a short break, the series returned with the seventh week being broadcast in the week beginning 17 May 2010.[8] It then took another break in the middle of July and returned on 13 September 2010, running til the 100th object was featured on Friday 22 October 2010.

TRANSCRIPT<br><br>

JEFFREY BROWN: A two-million-year-old stone chopping tool from Tanzania, a double-headed serpent from around the 16th century in Mexico, a credit card issued in the United Arab Emirates in 2009 ― just three of the objects that, according to a new book, help us understand our past and who we are today.
<br><br>
The book is “A History of the World in 100 Objects,” all of which are taken from the British Museum, which has been collecting objects for more than 250 years.<br><br>

The author is Neil MacGregor, director of the museum. And he joins me now.
<br><br>
And welcome to you.<br><br>

NEIL MACGREGOR, “A History of the World in 100 Objects”: Thank you very much.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, we go to museums like yours, right, and we look at things, stuff. But the contention here that you can pick a hundred of these things and somehow draw a history of the world?<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Yes, quite a brave contention.
<br><br>
What we were trying to do was argue that, actually, when you go to a museum, the big thing to do is really focus on a single object, choose one and get into it. And if you take one object and go into it in-depth, then you learn a lot about the people that made it, why they made it, the world it was for, and what it is to be a person needing objects and making objects. You learn a lot about us almost in the object.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: And in this case, you put a bunch of objects, 100 objects, together.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Yes. We chose 100 that go from the very beginning of human history, of making things.
<br><br>
So the first things we make are about two million years ago. And we start there. And we wanted to keep going round the world at different moments in history, up until today, sort of see what have we made and why have we made it? That’s the interesting thing, why we made these things anywhere in the world and what do they tell us about us?
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, tell me about that first one, that earliest one, right?
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: This is just about the oldest thing that anybody like us made, made about nearly two million years ago in Tanzania in East Africa.
<br><br>
And it looks just like a (INAUDIBLE) but then at the top ridge there has been chipped away very carefully to give a sharp edge. And these are the tools. This is the Swiss army knife of the Stone Age.
<br><br>
(LAUGHTER)
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: And it’s this kind of tool that lets us all leave Africa and live everywhere, because this lets you strip the meat off the animals to get more protein, break the bones to get the marrow. Then you can use it to take the branches off the trees, skin the hides. This is what lets us…
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Become us.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Become us.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: As you say in the beginning, it allows people to eat better, to grow better, to develop a better brain, everything, right?
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Everything. Everything comes from that.
<br><br>
And we, having made this thing, we now depend on it. And for most of human history, this is the most important technology. This is the technological discovery of humanity.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, now, you describe that one as a first one. But how do you pick the objects? I mean, there have been ― was it fun? Were there a lot of arguments about…
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: There were huge arguments.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: It was the greatest fun ever, because the idea was we would spin the world and say what’s going on around in 2,000 years ago, 1,000 years ago?
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Spin the world and take walks through your own museum.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Walks through the museum and walks through time.
<br><br>
And what is going in China, what is going on in Mexico, in Egypt? And the thing then lets you go on this walk into another world. They open the poetry of another existence that we can only know the things, because obviously nobody wrote what they were doing with this. So we have got to take the things, imagine it and recover it.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: One interesting aspect that comes through as I have looked through here, you often cite the impact of an object in its own era, but then through time, in different eras.
<br><br>
A famous example, of course, is the Rosetta stone, one of your most famous objects. It had its own time, but then through Napoleonic era and up to our own.<br><br>

NEIL MACGREGOR: That’s the great joy of objects, that they’re made for one purpose and then over time they do something completely unexpected.<br><br>

The Rosetta stone is actually a tax break between the king and the church. The Greek king says that he will give the priests a tax break if they pray for him. Fine. And this is announced on the stone tablet, and dozens of copies all through Egypt. And that all ends, all breaks down, ruins, whatever.
<br><br>
And in the 17 ― late 1790s, when the French have invaded Egypt, they start digging up to fortify themselves at Rosetta. They come across the stone. And then the British arrive to stop the French taking Egypt.
<br><br>
(LAUGHTER)<br><br>

JEFFREY BROWN: So we get into a different sort of history, right of European power and colonialism, right?
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: The beginning of European colonialism in Egypt. And then this object, which has the Greek and the Egyptian on it, is studied by the whole of Europe.
<br><br>
And it’s that object that now tells us how we can read ancient Egypt. But nobody making the stone ever thought, to start with, that they were going to provide the code for hieroglyphics, never crossed their mind. And that is what is wonderful about objects. They mean different things as time goes on.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course, another interesting aspect of this is many things simply don’t survive, right? So we don’t know about some of the missing pieces of history.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: No.<br><br>

That’s the ― and obviously, we only have bits and pieces of the story. And the main things that don’t survive, of course, are textiles or things made of wood in wet climates.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. I notice when you get to a piece of clothing, you say something about it. We’re halfway through, we’re about a million years into human history. This is the first piece of cloth.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: That survives.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Paper doesn’t survive very often. So it’s very patchy. But that’s another part of the game, because it means you have to imagine what didn’t survive and remember what didn’t survive.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: What about ― I want to go to the last object of the book.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Yes.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: It’s a solar-powered lamp. Now, you write here that it was hard to decide what should be the last thing, right? Because now you’re up to our own era.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: We wanted to choose an object that would tell us about the world today and this extraordinary global world we live in, where we’re all in constant contact with each other.
<br><br>
We thought we would go back to the beginning of the story, the way somebody in East Africa was using an object to change their life. And this is now changing the life of millions of people in the tropics. It’s a solar panel which powers both a lamp and a mobile phone recharger.
<br><br>
And with this lamp, anybody working in a hut, living in a hut, away from main electricity, for the first time has light at night. This means they can read, they can study. It also means they don’t need to have kerosene lamps. So it’s better for health. With the mobile phone charger, they can sell their produce better in the local markets.
<br><br>
This is evening up the great divide between the city and the country among the poorest people on the planet. And the technology is of course American. The microtechnology was invented in the U.S. It’s fabricated in China and sold in Africa. And it’s another tool that’s going to let us change the world.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: So the story continues.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: The story continues.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you, finally, this was ― this book was based on, I gather it was an enormously popular BBC radio program, right? Now, the book was a bestseller in Britain. Now it’s out here.
<br><br>
What do you think it is that grabs people so much about looking at things like this?
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: I think that the point is that a single object lets you explore a world that you want to know about. We all want to know a bit about what it is like to see the world from Sudan or from Korea or from Mexico.
<br><br>
And it’s difficult to read long books on that. A thing lets you journey immediately into another world. And it’s a thing made by somebody like you with hands like yours, a mind like yours. And you’re on a journey of poetic imagination to a place that you could never reach otherwise.
<br><br>
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.
<br><br>
We’re going to continue this conversation online. We will go through the entire history of the world, but for now…
<br><br>
(LAUGHTER)  <br><br>

JEFFREY BROWN: … Neil MacGregor is the director of the British Museum. And his new book is “A History of the World in 100 Objects.”<br><br>

Thanks so much.
<br><br>
NEIL MACGREGOR: Thank you.

 Neil MacGregor  <br><br>

 TEDGlobal Filmed Jul 2011  	<br><br>
 interactive transcript  	<br><br>
A clay cylinder covered in Akkadian cuneiform script, damaged and broken, the Cyrus Cylinder is a powerful symbol of religious tolerance and multi-culturalism. In this enthralling talk Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, traces 2600 years of Middle Eastern history through this single object. 	<br><br>
0:11	<br><br>
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us. We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things. Which means that, while we all have one biography, they have many. 	<br><br>
0:31	<br><br>
I want this morning to talk about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object, one remarkable thing. It doesn't, I agree, look very much. It's about the size of a rugby ball. It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun. And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879. But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East. And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet. 	<br><br>
1:29	<br><br>
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces, the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change. And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with, Belshazzar's feast -- because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war of 539 BC. And the parallels between the events of 539 BC and 2003 and in between are startling. What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting, now in the National Gallery in London, illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures. And you all know roughly the story. 	<br><br>
2:22	<br><br>
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon. Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels. He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple. And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon. Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast. And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels. He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia. 	<br><br>
3:01	<br><br>
And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, "You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians." And that very night Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell. It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people. It's a great story. It's story we all know. "The writing on the wall" is part of our everyday language. What happened next was remarkable, and it's where our cylinder enters the story. 	<br><br>
3:48	<br><br>
Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus. And Cyrus makes a declaration. And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world." They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see. This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. And it's written, as we'll see in due course, by very skilled P.R. consultants. So the hyperbole is not actually surprising. 	<br><br>
4:48	<br><br>
And what is the great king, the powerful king, the king of the four quarters of the world going to do? He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon, he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free. He'll let them return to their countries. And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated. All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods. And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way, in their own place. This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home. They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. 	<br><br>
5:55	<br><br>
It's a central document in Jewish history. And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms. This is the Jewish version of the same story. "Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia, 'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem. Who is there among you of his people? The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'" "Go up" -- aaleh. The central element, still, of the notion of return, a central part of the life of Judaism. As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism. And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay. 	<br><br>
6:56	<br><br>
Two great texts, what about the politics? What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history. The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire. Cyrus begins in the 530s BC. And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control. This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it. It was the largest empire the world had known until then. Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale. And it had to be run in a quite new way. It had to be run in different languages. The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing. And it had to recognize their different habits, different peoples, different religions, different faiths. All of those are respected by Cyrus. 	<br><br>
7:58	<br><br>
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society. And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together. The Greek invasions ended that. And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented. But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. 	<br><br>
8:35	<br><br>
The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book "Cyropaedia" promoting Cyrus as the great ruler. And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model. This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was. And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. Jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state. 	<br><br>
9:19	<br><br>
Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well. After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. And it enters now another story. It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century: Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them? We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures. No other evidence. Suddenly, this appeared. And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true. It's a great 19th century moment. 	<br><br>
10:16	<br><br>
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated. Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect. The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk. And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk. "Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name." Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon. Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free. And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk. 	<br><br>
11:05	<br><br>
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this. For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen. It can only be Jehovah. And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact. 	<br><br>
11:49	<br><br>
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions. The question is, which god was it? And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion. And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk. And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, "I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me." I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah. And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk. Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts. 	<br><br>
12:46	<br><br>
(Laughter) 	<br><br>
12:48	<br><br>
That's 1879. 40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world. This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return. And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic. And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem. And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan. You all know what happened. The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over. And another story of the cylinder begins. 	<br><br>
14:01	<br><br>
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah. And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder. When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty. Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah. 	<br><br>
14:41	<br><br>
10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979. Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks. Then another Iran-Iraq war. And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won. It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout. And the obvious emblem is Cyrus. 	<br><br>
15:27	<br><br>
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. It's the only object they want. They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder. And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time. It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani. It was a huge event. This is the other side of that same picture. It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months. This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West. And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths. And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of. 	<br><br>
16:42	<br><br>
To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it. It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad. Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed? Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated? This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return. Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran. It was a narrative presented by the president himself. 	<br><br>
17:29	<br><br>
And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today. It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration. It stands with the American constitution. It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta. It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region. 	<br><br>
18:17	<br><br>
A replica of this is at the United Nations. In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place. And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures. It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories. And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder? The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely -- a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate. 	<br><br>
19:02	<br><br>
In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill. But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder. 	<br><br>
19:20	<br><br>
Thank you. 	<br><br>
19:22	<br><br>

我们所制造的物件 具有一项极其卓越的优点 它们比我们活得久 我们终将消逝，它们则万世长存 我们只有一世, 它们却有许多 而且每一世都有不同的意义 这就意味着，我们只能写一次传记 而它们却可以写很多次 	<br><br>
0:31	<br><br>
今早，我想谈谈 一件特殊的文物身上的故事，它的传记 它每一世的传记 这是件非凡的文物 我同意，它看起来 并不起眼 差不多是一只橄榄球的大小 用陶土制成 先做成一个 圆柱的形状 刻满楔形文字后 再在阳光下烘干 你可以看到 它上面有破损的痕迹 这并不奇怪 因为它已有超过2500年的历史了 它是在1879年 被挖掘出来的 但是今天 我相信 它在中东地区的政治领域 也扮演着重要的角色 在它身上 发生了很多精彩的故事 有些故事到现在也没有完结 	<br><br>
1:29	<br><br>
故事始于 两伊战争 以及随后一系列的事件 累积起来 针对伊拉克的 外国武装的入侵 暴君被推翻 政局发生骤变 我想从 那一系列事件中的一个章节开始说起 你们中的大多数对此不会陌生 那就是伯萨沙王的宴会 因为我们说的这场两伊战争 发生在公元前539年 而公元前539年 和2003年发生的事件 两者之间有 惊人的相似之处 你现在看到的是伦勃朗的油画作品 现陈列于伦敦的国家美术馆 这幅画阐释了希伯来圣经中的 但以理书 你们都知道故事的大概 	<br><br>
2:22	<br><br>
伯萨沙是尼布甲尼撒的儿子 尼布甲尼撒征服了以色列，洗劫了耶路撒冷 俘虏了那里的人民 将犹太人带到了巴比伦 不仅仅是犹太人，他还带回了圣殿的器皿 他将圣殿洗劫一空，还亵渎了神明 来自耶路撒冷圣殿中的金制器皿 被带回了巴比伦 他的儿子伯萨沙 决定举办一场盛宴 为了让宴会更加刺激 他又加了点亵渎神灵的余兴节目 他拿出了圣殿器皿 那时他已与伊朗人开战 和波斯国王也打得不可开交 	<br><br>
3:01	<br><br>
那天晚上，但以理告诉我们 在宴会达到高潮时 出现了一只手在墙上写字 你被称在天平里，显出你的亏欠 你的国分裂 归与玛代人和波斯人 就在那个晚上 波斯国王塞鲁士攻入巴比伦 整个伯萨沙政权覆灭了 当然 这是犹太人历史上 一个伟大的时刻 这是个精彩的故事，我们都知道 "墙上之字” (“不祥之兆”)这个说法 已经成为我们的日常用语 而接下来发生了 一件意义重大的事情 赛鲁士圆柱也在 此时出现而来 	<br><br>
3:48	<br><br>
波斯国王赛鲁士 不费一兵一卒就进入了巴比伦 而伟大的巴比伦帝国 国土从伊拉克中南部 一直延伸到地中海 却落于赛鲁士之手 接着赛鲁士发表了声明 声明内容就刻在这个圆柱上 这是统治者受到神的指引而发表的声明 神推翻了伊拉克的独裁统治 并将自由带给人民 在包围巴比伦时 有巴比伦语这样写道 他说：“我是赛鲁士，是整个宇宙的王 我是伟大的国王，是强盛的国王 我是巴比伦的国王，是世界之王“ 你看，他们夸张起来可真不害臊 这可能是 由获胜方发表的第一场 真正意义上的 新闻发布会 我们后来看到 它被技巧娴熟的公关顾问们记录下来了 所以这里的夸张其实并不叫人惊讶 	<br><br>
4:48	<br><br>
那么这位伟大而强盛的 世界之王打算做些什么呢 他接着说，征服巴比伦之后 他会立即让所有 被尼布甲尼撒和伯萨沙 俘虏和奴役的不同种族的人 获得自由 他会让他们回到自己的国家 更重要的是 他会让他们恢复信仰 并拿回 缴获的雕像 和圣殿器皿 所有受到巴比伦人压迫 和被掳至巴比伦的人都将回家 他们将与他们的神一同回去 他们可以修复他们的祭坛 并以他们自己的方式 在属于他们的地方，祭拜他们的神 这是就是当时颁布的法令 赛鲁士圆柱就是证据 证明了犹太人 被流放到巴比伦之后 好多年，他们都会坐在巴比伦的水畔 一想起耶路撒冷就会哭泣 那些犹太人被准许回家了 他们被允许回到耶路撒冷 重建神庙 	<br><br>
5:55	<br><br>
这在犹太历史上 是一份核心文件 在希伯来圣经里的历代志和以斯拉记中 也清楚的记载着 下面是关于同一个故事的 犹太版本 “因此，波斯国王赛鲁士说 '上天的神耶和华天下万国赐给我， 又嘱咐我 在犹大的耶路撒冷为他建造一座殿宇 你们中间凡是作为他的子民的 愿上帝与这人同在 你们要回归耶路撒冷建造他的神殿“ “回归耶路撒冷” 这里的核心要素 仍然是回归 这也是犹太教教义的 核心部分 你们知道，结束流放回到耶路撒冷 和第二神殿 重塑了犹太教 那次改变 那个伟大的历史时刻 是由波斯国王赛鲁士实现的 这一切在希伯来圣经中都有记载 也用巴比伦语刻在赛鲁士圆柱上 	<br><br>
6:56	<br><br>
这是两篇伟大的文献 那么政治上又如何呢 那时所发生的事 是中东历史上一个根本性的转变 伊朗，米底和波斯帝国 被赛鲁士统一 成为第一个伟大的世界帝国 赛鲁士于公元前530年左右开始统治 到了他的儿子大流士的时期 整个东地中海 都处于波斯的统治之下 事实上，这个帝国 也就是我们现在所熟知的中东 它形成了现在的中东地区 在那个时期，它是世界上最大的帝国 更重要的是 它是第一个 规模如此宏大的 多文化，多信仰的国家 所以必须采用新的方法来治理这个帝国 必须采用多语言的治理方式 其实巴比伦语版本的法令说明了这一点 还必须认识到人民的不同习俗 不同民族，不同宗教和不同信仰 所有这一切都受到赛鲁士的尊重 	<br><br>
7:58	<br><br>
他建立了一个模式 即如何治理一个庞大的 多民族，多信仰和多文化的社会 他这样做的结果就是 这个帝国涵盖了你在屏幕上所看到的地区 并享有了长达200年的稳定 直到被亚历山大大帝推翻 它给中东的统一留下了一个梦 即不同信仰的人们 能够和平共处 然而希腊的入侵结束了这一切 当然，亚历山大大帝无法维持一个政府 帝国变得四分五裂 但是赛鲁士所代表的意义 仍然保持绝对的核心地位 	<br><br>
8:35	<br><br>
希腊历史学家色诺芬 在他所著的《赛鲁士的教育》一书中 认为赛鲁士是一位伟大的统治者 且在之后的整个欧洲文化中 赛鲁士仍然是楷模 这个16世纪的形象 向你展示了人们对赛鲁士 是多么的崇敬 色诺芬关于赛鲁士 及如何治理一个多样化的社会的书 是对引领美国革命的国父们 起到激励作用的 最伟大的课本之一 杰弗逊就是其仰慕者之一 赛鲁士的典范 清楚的向18世纪的理念证明了 如何在一个新的国家 建立宗教宽容的氛围 	<br><br>
9:19	<br><br>
现在让我们在回头看看巴比伦 情况并不好 在亚历山大大帝建立新的国家之后 巴比伦开始衰落，化为一片废墟 所有关于伟大的巴比伦帝国的痕迹都遗落了 直到1879年 大英博物馆为了寻找展品 在巴比伦挖出赛鲁士圆柱为止 现在它又引发了另一个故事 它引发了19世纪中期 那场伟大的辩论 圣经可靠么？我们能够相信它么？ 我们只能 从希伯来圣经上得知 犹太人的回归和赛鲁士的法令 再没有别的证据可以证明了 突然之间，这件文物出现了 对于那些相信圣经 却被进化论和地质学 动摇了对创世纪的信仰的人们来说 这是一项振奋人心的证据 它证明了 圣经在历史上的真实性 这是19世纪的一个伟大时刻 	<br><br>
10:16	<br><br>
但是，这也让事情变得更加复杂 这些事实都是真的 对于考古学来说是个好消息 但对它的解读却越加复杂 因为圆柱上的描述与希伯来圣经上的描述 有一个关键的差异 圆柱上的巴比伦语 是由信奉巴比伦的主神马杜克的 祭祀写就的 所以他们告诉你这一切都是马杜克的功劳 这一点也不奇怪 “马杜克，我们所信奉的神，召唤了赛鲁士” 马杜克拉着赛鲁士的手 告诉他要管理好人民 并赋予他治理巴比伦的权力 马杜克告诉赛鲁士 他要做这些伟大而慷慨的事 来让人民自由 这就是为什么我们都应对马杜克 心怀感激和崇敬 	<br><br>
11:05	<br><br>
而希伯来圣经的作者 则在旧约中 表达了完全不同的看法 这也不奇怪 当然，对他们来说 不可能是马杜克 只能是耶和华造就了这一切 所以在以赛亚书中 我们能找到相应的文本 这一切的功劳 不属于马杜克 而属于以色列的主神耶和华 耶和华 也召唤了赛鲁士 也拉着赛鲁士的手 让他管理好人民 同一件事拥有两种不同宗教的描述 同一个政治事件 有两种不同宗教的解读 这是个绝佳的例子 	<br><br>
11:49	<br><br>
我们知道 神往往站在军事力量强大的那一方 但问题是，是哪一个神呢？ 这场辩论 让19世纪时的每个人都觉得不安 它让人们认识到希伯来圣经 只是一个更广阔的宗教世界的一部分 很明显 赛鲁士圆柱比以赛亚书要更为古老 然而，耶和华所说的话 与马杜克所说的 非常相似 可能以赛亚对这个事件有些略微的了解 因为他说 当然， 是神说 “我召唤你 虽然你并不知道我“ 我认为这是承认 赛鲁士并未意识到 他所听从的是耶和华的命令 他对于听从马杜克的命令也同样感到吃惊 因为，有趣的是 赛鲁士是一个不错的伊朗人 他另有一整套不同的神的体系 而这些神从未在任何文本中被提到过 	<br><br>
12:46	<br><br>
(笑) 	<br><br>
12:48	<br><br>
那场辩论是1879年的事 40年之后 到了1917年 赛鲁士圆柱进入了一个不同的世界 这是一个属于当代世界 属于实际政治的年代 这一年发表了贝尔福宣言 这一年在中东崛起的新帝国 英帝国决定建立 一个犹太人的民族家园 它将准许 犹太人的回归 身处东欧的犹太人 对于这件事的反应是狂热的 犹太人在整个东欧 将赛鲁士 和乔治五世的图画 并排展示 这两位伟大的统治者 准许犹太人回归耶路撒冷 赛鲁士圆柱也进入了公众的视野 其上的文本是神的旨意的一部分 它展示出 为什么战后发生的事 会在1918年结束 你们都知道发生了什么 以色列建国了 50年后，在20世纪60年代末 很明显，英国的帝国主义也走到了尽头 另一个关于赛鲁士圆柱的故事开始了 	<br><br>
14:01	<br><br>
英国和美国决定 民族家园地区不应受到共产主义的影响 而应起到保护作用的即将诞生的超级大国 将会是沙王所领导的伊朗 因此沙王创造了伊朗的历史 或者说是伊朗回归的历史 这让他成为一项伟大传统的核心 并发行 印有他自己 和赛鲁士圆柱的硬币 当他在波斯波利斯举办盛大的庆典时 他要求赛鲁士圆柱回到伊朗 大英博物馆遂借出圆柱，并送往德黑兰 这成为巴列维王朝 伟大庆典的一部分 赛鲁士圆柱就是沙王统治的保证 	<br><br>
14:41	<br><br>
10年后，另一个故事拉开了帷幕 即1979年的伊朗革命 这是伊斯兰革命，与赛鲁士无关 我们对那段历史并不感兴趣 我们感兴趣的是具有伊斯兰特色的伊朗 直到伊拉克 那个我们都认为应属于该地区势力范围的新生力量 发动了攻击 这又是一场两伊战争 伊朗人能否铭记他们那伟大的历史 就变得很关键 在那段历史中 他们战胜了伊拉克 至关重要的一点是找到一个象征 让所有伊朗人团结起来 让穆斯林，非穆斯林 基督徒，索罗亚斯德教教徒，居住在伊朗的犹太人 和那些无论虔诚与否的人都团结起来 显然，赛鲁士圆柱是最合适的象征 	<br><br>
15:27	<br><br>
所以当大英博物馆和德黑兰国家博物馆 展开合作时，就像我们一直以来所做的那样 伊朗人只要求 借一样东西 这是他们唯一想要的东西 他们想借赛鲁士圆柱 去年 赛鲁士圆柱被送往德黑兰 这已经是第二次了 它由德黑兰国家博物馆馆长 亲手放进盒子里 这位馆长是一位伊朗妇女，地位非常崇高 她就是艾达卡尼女士 这是一次隆重的事件 故事的另外一面 在德黑兰 仅在几个月之内，就有一两百万的人 参观了居鲁士圆柱 这次展出的轰动效应 在西方前所未见 这也是一场伟大辩论的主题 即赛鲁士圆柱意味着什么，赛鲁士又意味着什么 但首先，圆柱上所描写的赛鲁士 是家国的捍卫者 是为伊朗身份和伊朗人民 而奋斗的战士 他能够对所有的信仰都宽容相待 在当今伊朗 索罗亚斯德教教徒和基督徒 在伊朗议会中的地位得以保障，这是非常值得自豪的 	<br><br>
16:42	<br><br>
为了在德黑兰一睹这件展品 居住在伊朗的数万犹太人 前往德黑兰 赛鲁士圆柱成为了一个伟大的象征 一场辩论的主题 关于伊朗在国内外的意义 伊朗仍然是被压迫人民的守护者么？ 伊朗仍会赋予那些 被暴君奴役和剥削的人们以自由么？ 这是令人振奋的全国性的讨论 它由一场 关于回归的隆重盛会 所激发 在这里，你能看到巨大的赛鲁士圆柱 与伊朗历史中的伟人一起在舞台上 明确他们在伊朗传统中 所占有的一席之地 这是伊朗总统 亲口叙述的 	<br><br>
17:29	<br><br>
对我来说 将赛鲁士圆柱送回伊朗 或者说被允许将它送回伊朗 就是被允许成为 一场最高层次的 伟大辩论的一部分 这场辩论是关于伊朗是什么 到底有多少个不同的伊朗 以及伊朗不同的历史 将会对今天的世界产生怎样的影响 这场辩论仍在继续 它将继续产生轰动的效应 因为赛鲁士圆柱 是象征人类渴望的 伟大的声明之一 它与美国的宪法具有同等地位 他当然比大宪章更能代表 真正的自由 它是一份文件，对伊朗和整个地区 都具有深远的意义 	<br><br>
18:17	<br><br>
它的一份复制品 在联合国 今年秋天，在纽约 当关于中东未来的伟大辩论开始时 它将被展出 我想要问你们几个问题来结束我的演讲 赛鲁士圆柱将引发的下一个故事 又是什么呢？ 当然，赛鲁士圆柱 会出现在很多的中东故事里 那么你们希望看到 在中东 和世界上发生怎样的故事 来体现赛鲁士圆柱 所表达的意义呢？ 不同的民族有权利 在同一个国家生活 自由的供奉自己信仰的宗教 在中东这个世界里 宗教已不再是辩论 或引发分裂的主题了 	<br><br>
19:02	<br><br>
目前的中东世界里 辩论仍然十分激烈 但我认为很有可能 这些声音中最有力最明智的那一个 将会是来自 这件沉默的物品 来自赛鲁士圆柱 	<br><br>
19:20	<br><br>
谢谢 	<br><br>
19:22	<br><br>
（鼓掌） 	<br><br>

Germany: Memories of a Nation; 21st-Century Mythologies C radio review 
<br><br>



Neil McGregor packs more into a 15-minute programme than an O-level C he makes Peter Conrad on Barthes seem like a doddle
<br><br>

My favourite Radio 4 format is the 15-minute documentary serial: all the info, none of the faff, perfect for download/podcast listening. Of course, Neil McGregor, director of the British Museum, gave us the daddy of all these series with his 2010 masterwork, A History of the World in 100 Objects. (Some stats: more than 4 million regular listeners and more than 10 million podcast subscribers, about half of whom are from outside the UK. And, because the programmes are still available, those numbers are rising.) He revisited his successful format, an object that opens up a subject, for Shakespeare’s Restless World in 2012. And now he’s back again with Germany: Memories of a Nation.
<br><br>
Crikey, McGregor is formidable. So much knowledge: of history and art and politics and geography and religion. Of everything. He is the don of donnishness, giving us mini-lectures packed with memorable images, with pertinent facts and dates; but also expert commentators who take established opinion to task. It’s amazing how much he gets in, and when I’m feeling slow I can find McGregor’s programmes impenetrably dense. You can’t let your mind wander off to what you’re having for tea; two minutes’ loss of concentration and you’ll have missed something vital. Plus, if you didn’t do history O-level, which I didn’t, his assumption of your familiarity with important events, such as the Reformation, can make you wail.
<br><br>
But you know, that’s what Google is for, and it is always far, far better to have a presenter assume that you know stuff than assume that you don’t. I like programmes that say “Keep up!” rather than “Shall we go over that again?” And Germany: Memories of a Nation has already made me understand Germany far better than I did before C I now have a grasp of how Germany as a nation is actually a collection of small, independently minded city-states. I understand the significance of Charlemagne (or Karl der Gross) to both France and Germany; and how German manufacturing has long been associated with quality. And, crucially, I can remember this information because McGregor has rooted it in actual things: in beer and sausages, in Charlemagne’s crown, in a Holbein portrait of a German merchant who lived in London in the 1530s.
<br><br>
The only thing that McGregor’s programmes lack sometimes is a tweak of cheek or humour. Luckily, on the Holbein programme, which was about Hansa, a pan-Europe alliance of trading cities that lasted from the 13th century to the 19th, Hilary Mantel popped up to give her take. Mantel’s way with words really helped. She pointed out that the Holbein portrait was very likely to have been altered for the subject’s prospective bride (to show “this is what I look like on the eve of our marriage”), and was, she said, “a mug shot done by a genius”.<br><br>
Another great white academic taking advantage of Radio 4’s 15-minute approach is Peter Conrad, who is busy doing a rethink of Roland Barthes’s seminal Mythologies in his own 21st-Century Mythologies. I like these programmes, though after a McGregor binge their discursiveness can seem almost lightweight, which is ridiculous. This is Peter Conrad we’re talking about. Anyhow, Conrad has taken our young century’s embarrassment of lightweight subjects C the selfie, the Kardashians, e-cigarettes C and put them up to merciless scrutiny.

<br><br>
 


Conrad ponders whether or not his chosen subjects have become contemporary myths, and with some he seems to believe they have. His ruminations on the e-cigarette were very Barthesian: Barthes himself spent time considering the “real” cigarette. Conrad concluded that, for all the commercial attempts to make vaping clean, modern, unthreatening, it is still rooted in “residue”, in “embers and ash”, because myths, according to Barthes, often settle for a “degraded survival”. Instead of passing away into obscurity, as cigarettes appeared to be doing, they have continued, but only in a warped, dying facsimile of their original selves.<br><br>

These programmes are, again, a little tough if you’re feeling stupid. But there is also a lot of tinder-dry humour. The disdain with which Conrad presented his description of Kim Kardashian’s belfie (her “leotard” snicked by her “bodily ravines”) could not fail to be clocked by the slowest of brains. And it certainly made me laugh.

Neil MacGregor has been Director of the British Museum since August 2002. He was Director of the National Gallery in London from 1987 to 2002. His celebrated books include A History of the World in 100 Objects, now translated into more than a dozen languages and one of the top-selling titles ever published by Penguin Press, and Shakespeare's Restless World. 	<br><br>
A major new series from the makers of A History Of The World In 100 Objects, exploring the fascinating and complex history of Germany from the origins of the Holy Roman Empire right up to the present day. 	<br><br>
	
	
Germany: Memories of a Nation by Neil MacGregor review	<br><br>
Germany’s past is indeed another country 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
A detailed analysis of Germany’s history goes a long way to understanding its people and its turbulent politics 	<br><br>
	
	
The histories, identities and borders of most continental countries have usually been shaped by war. This is especially true of Germany, whose national consciousness sprang from the humiliations inflicted by Napoleon. Germany became a sovereign reality only in 1870 with the defeat of France and the proclamation of the German empire C the Second Reich C in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.	<br><br>
	
In the preceding centuries under the First Reich of the Holy Roman empire, the patchwork of princely states and bishoprics had little more than the German language as a common bond. As Neil MacGregor, our greatest cultural polymath, demonstrates in this excellent book to accompany the exhibition at the British Museum and the BBC Radio 4 series, “Germany” could be defined only by where German was spoken. And even then there was “high German” in the south and “low German” in the north, with a host of dialects ranging from the Volga Germans in Russia to the Saxons in Transylvania.	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
The great unifier was Martin Luther, whose translation of the Bible brought the language together and spread it thanks to Gutenberg’s printing presses. But Luther also proved to be the great religious divider in the schism that led to the 30 years war, a conflict as horrific in its time as the second world war. In 1945, as the Red Army rampaged into German territory, the terrified population sought comfort in singing Luther’s hymn A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.	<br><br>
	
Literacy spread through the bureaucracies of the German statelets and craftsmanship flourished under the guild system. Craftsmen seized the opportunities that came from being at the centre of trade routes, and the most skilled profited as princes tried to impress one another by vying to offer the most original diplomatic gifts. High-class production thrived. In Mainz, there was Gutenberg; in Nuremberg, Albrecht Durer, the inventor of the logo with his initials, mass-produced art through prints; Meissen porcelain, like other inventions borrowed from the Chinese, was developed by Augustus of Saxony near Dresden; and clockmaking, scientific instruments and work in precious and other metals achieved new heights in other cities. After the Napoleonic wars, commercial competition forced the end of the guilds, yet the German reputation for rigorous quality and inventiveness endured. On a more ominous note, the advance in precision engineering also improved German armaments.	<br><br>
	
Wars against France, the dominant power in Europe, had left their mark. Louis XIV’s seizure of Strassburg, making it the French city of Strasbourg, was never forgotten. The city was re-Germanised twice more, after the Franco-Prussian war and in 1940. But it was Napoleon’s subjugation of German states in 1806 that triggered a sense of nationalism. Konigsberg, the birthplace of the Prussian state, was also the site of its rebirth in the struggle against Napoleon. The “Iron Kingdom” had been partially militarised under Frederick the Great and his father, but a far more intense process took place in the decades following Napoleon’s invasion.	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
The new nationalism in the wake of Napoleon encouraged Germans to look back to a mythical and semi-mythical past: to Nibelungen as well as to Hermann’s victory in the Teutoburg Forest over the Roman legions in AD9. A vast statue of Hermann facing towards France was built there after the Napoleonic wars and finally completed in 1875.	<br><br>
	
The forests of Germany, meanwhile, took on a special significance, whether the dark stories of the Brothers Grimm, the spiritual loneliness of Caspar David Friedrich’s paintings or the emotional relationship with nature of the Wandervogel movement. A symbolic importance was invested in the eternal oak, with its leaf used on coins and medals. The higher version of Hitler’s Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross was decorated with oak leaves C the Eichenlaub.	<br><br>
	
This fear and love of forests, encompassing both good and evil, almost certainly linked to the Sturm und Drang movement of early Romanticism, suggests a paradoxical influence in the German consciousness. Goethe’s dark works, The Sorrows of Young Werther and Faust, exist alongside a meridional love of light and lemon blossom in Italy. Whether that great German flaw, the confusion of cause and effect that produced the stab-in-the-back legend after the first world war, is another aspect of that split personality is hard to say. But while embittered Freikorps set out to crush the revolutions of 1918 and 1919, the German National Assembly chose Weimar, the city of Goethe and Schiller, as the symbolic beginning of their ill-fated republic.	<br><br>
	
Anyone who wants to understand Germany should read this book, yet along with every observer of its past, MacGregor remains baffled by the juxtaposition of humanism and authoritarianism. The concentration camp of Buchenwald lay in the woods outside Weimar where Goethe used to walk. How could the great humanistic traditions of Germany have become perverted into unimaginable cruelty? Our fascination with the question will probably never end, mainly because the second world war presented more moral choices than any other period in history, especially to all those Germans who were not Nazis. “What would we have done?” MacGregor rightly demands of those who were not there.	<br><br>
	
The suffering caused by the demented ambitions of the Nazi regime is still beyond the comprehension of normal human beings. And the tragedy for Germans in the east in 1945 was also immense, with 12 to 14 million refugees dispossessed, many admittedly from land and houses seized from Poles and others. In farm wagons and pulling handcarts through the snow, they risked being crushed under the tracks of Red Army tanks. During this flight to the west and the subsequent ethnic cleansing, between half a million and two million people died, mainly women and children. Konigsberg, the birthplace of Immanuel Kant and Kathe Kollwitz, was annihilated and became the Soviet city of Kaliningrad. Breslau, or what remained of it, became Polish.	<br><br>
	
The summer of 1945 was Stunde Null C zero hour C when Germany was reduced to nothing, its cities smashed by allied bombing. With their menfolk in prison camps or traumatised by defeat, the country was saved by its women, working as Trummerfrauen, or “rubble women”, clearing the debris and piling the bricks ready to build anew. Along with the refugees, Germans gritted their teeth and worked. The economic miracle C the Wirtschaftswunder C led Germany to become the great export car maker of the time. The rigorous metal craftsmanship of old developed into the Vorsprung durch Technik of the modern age.	<br><br>
	
At the same time came a great break with the past. In January 1979, the American miniseries Holocaust was broadcast in the Federal Republic. The younger generation began to question their parents about the war. The period of denial was over. And following the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, the Reichstag was redesigned, incorporating a glass viewing platform for the people to look down and watch their leaders, in stark contrast to the way they had been watched by the Gestapo and the Stasi. With the symbol of the rebuilt Reichstag, the German people have completely reinvented themselves. The memories are there, and it is right that they should remain, but that past is indeed another country.	<br><br>

Following on from the global success of A History of the World in 100 Objects, Neil MacGregor is back with a new 30-part series.	<br><br>

Germany: Memories of a Nation	<br><br>
BBC Radio 4	<br><br>
	
By the time A History of the World in 100 Objects concluded in October 2010, it had been established as one of the exceptional bodies of work yet broadcast by the BBC. It was unique in its telling of history purely through objects and every episode was awaited with confidence and impatience.	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
The final artefact C a solar-powered lamp and charger, whose technology could give clean, cheap energy to women in parts of Africa who would otherwise be forced to use the sulphur dioxide-emitting kerosene C was a typically humane choice from the presenter and British Museum director, Neil MacGregor, who combines sensitivity with analytical power. Notable at the time was this statistic: not only had the podcasts of the series been downloaded ten million times but half of those had been from abroad by listeners following it on BBC World Service. The enterprise was globally adored and surely unrepeatably so.	<br><br>
	
Only two episodes of MacGregor’s new 30-part series (weekdays, 9.45am) were available to listen to in advance C concerning a piece of Grete Marks’s pottery from the Bauhaus school, considered entartete Kunst (“degenerate art”) by the mid-1930s, and the 1574 astronomical clock inside Strasbourg Cathedral C but we have been promised 600 years of German history through objects as various as a bratwurst and a Bible. So confident is the BBC of another raging success that there will be a variety of accompanying programming on Radio 4 Extra, plumbing further hidden depths C Benedict Cumberbatch reading Kafka’s Metamorphosis, Philip Pullman reading the Brothers Grimm C like extras on a special edition DVD.	<br><br>
	
And why not? The way MacGregor moves from object to general history is quite simply the perfect broadcasting idea of the new century and probably the best use of the 15-minute programme yet commissioned. So much better than talking about an incident, or a battle, or the death of a king, or the life of a person, because a thing C something manufactured or made C requires the sort of serious social context that removes any suggestion that this is a gimmick. If you did Bismarck in 15 minutes, people would immediately think it was a novelty. Instead, the form and content here fit perfectly: dense, thrillingly non-linear, modern.	<br><br>
	
MacGregor’s narrative gift is striking, whether describing the “loose-splashed glaze suggestive of modernist painting” on the vase or, more beautifully, the clock on which “the changing faces of the moon are indicated [and] the position of the sun is charted . . . Every hour, the universal tyranny of time is rehearsed.” His tone C recorded in a studio, or a storeroom in the museum, or a crowded square abroad C is always the same. He’s unhurried, precise, possibly reading from a script but very possibly not.	<br><br>
	
There is an almost mystical sense that this formula could go on forever, with MacGregor increasingly cast as a talker of Coleridgean brilliance (Anthony Blunt, who first met MacGregor in Bavaria at a summer school, called him “the most brilliant pupil” he had ever taught). As he ranges all over his subject, thinking continually of anecdotes that might ground or illuminate, he often settles on the most filmic. When describing the burning of 20,000 books in Berlin’s Bebelplatz in 1933, he mentions that Erich Kastner was in the crowd watching his novel Emil and the Detectives go up in flames C this without a hint of drama.	<br><br>
	
It is this clean, held-back quality that makes MacGregor’s work rewarding. He can declare, without bitterness, “This was never going to be a vase in which a good Nazi arranged flowers!” and he can eschew sarcasm entirely when flagging up the absurdity in paranoiacally seeking “Jewish characteristics in a flower vase”. The voice is untheatrical and yet deeply old fashioned in the way that Virginia Woolf’s or Iris Murdoch’s was old fashioned C a way that now makes his narration sound to us like a lost bit of poetry. It’s a cultivated voice constructed to form beautiful words such as “Chagall” and “Munch” and also enunciate C like a voice-over artist proving his mastery of micro-technique C “Strasbourg” as though it were a German city and then, seconds later, as though it were French.	<br><br>
	
Yet he still manages to make the syllables of certain names sound ineffably unclean. “Goebbels”. It’s as though some raw nerve were ever so lightly being touched and as shockingly effective as a full bottle smashing on a stone pavement seconds before a fight. More please! 	<br><br>

Germany: The Memories of a Nation by Neil Macgregor, book review	<br><br>
Past is another country	<br><br>
	
 Rebecca K Morrison   	<br><br>

'Germany? Where is it? / I do not know where to find such a country," wrote Goethe and Schiller in 1796. Neil MacGregor's alternative cultural history of a country uniquely difficult to pinpoint C its borders shifting, its ruling systems manifold for much of the past 500 years C offers the sense of a coherent whole nonetheless.	<br><br>
 	
	
	
His method is memory. His way in is through objects and people; places and buildings; paintings, toys and printed money; forests and single oak trees; a porcelain menagerie; a crudely built handcart as pertinent to the Thirty Years War as to the 1945 refugee crisis; a flag waved in the revolutionary fervour of 1848, 1919 and 1989; a Greek temple to German greatness above the Danube conceived when Napoleon held sway; the Baltic amber harvest; Durer's engravings; lime-wood carvings by "Germany's Donatello"; how Lufthansa got its name; Gutenberg's 1450s printing press, inspired by Mainz's wine-presses; the lettering of the 1920s liberal Bauhaus movement upon the gates of Buchenwald concentration camp in the forest where Goethe walked, and the first performance of Bach's cantata with the same three words at its heart C Jedem das Seine ('To each what they are due'); and a "hovering angel" in the British Museum with its qualities of Erinnerung und innere Schau ("recollection and inner reflection") C the sculptor Ernst Barlach's "war memorials perhaps the nearest German equivalent to the British war poets' laments".	<br><br>
	
	
	
MacGregor knows unerringly which objects to select and which chapters of Germany's "enrichingly and confusingly fragmented history" to bring to life through them. One object can be interpreted in myriad ways, he argues, depending through which lens of collective German memory one is looking. To read at the measured pace dictated by the narrative voice (those who have listened to the Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 Objects will know the companionship of MacGregor's calm cadences, beautiful German, and un-showy erudition), is to discover answers to those questions which can be answered: here, then, are analyses of Charlemagne; the Holy Roman Empire, the Thirty Years War and the Peasants' War; the elusive matter of borders and those "phantom limbs" of German cultural memory (Kant's Konigsberg, Kafka's Prague); an exploration of Prussia; the reach of Bismarck, who made "the art of the possible" his own; the historic role of the Rhine C "German river, or German frontier?"; and why Heine's poem "The Lorelei" was once attributed to "Anon".	<br><br>
	
Language is a powerful leitmotif: the "triumph of translation" that is Martin Luther's 1534 bible, where "language has a new purpose, to speak to everybody, the Gospel translated not as theology, but as conversations you might overhear … Jesus speaking as a German carpenter to a German fisherman". There is mention of the Brothers Grimm's great dictionary project through to Thomas Mann's 1945 speech at the Library of Congress: "the German language … is my true homeland."	<br><br>
	
The chapter on the centuries-long tradition of apprenticeships fascinates: pride in good craftsmanship, the reassuring "Made in Germany", and "the hum and thrum of the music of precision engineering" as one of the enablers of Wirtschaftwunder, the economic miracle; the Trummerfrauen ("rubble women") another: "their strength, emotional and physical, put the country back on its feet", the hard work offering perhaps a temporary escape from "uncomfortable truths". And here MacGregor alludes to those posed but unanswerable questions which have led to an unparalleled exercise "in painful self-recollection" in the 25-year-old New Germany.	<br><br>
	
This book is immaculately researched, timely and important C and it is also good to be reminded of Kant's awe of "the starry sky above me and the moral law within me".	<br><br>

Germany: Memories of a Nation by Neil MacGregor, review: 'a highly superior guide'	<br><br>
	
Neil MacGregor’s portrait of the German nation using a selection of art and artefacts is timely and affecting 	<br><br>
	
	
By Miranda Seymour	<br><br>
 07 Nov 2014	<br><br>
	
Four years ago, Neil MacGregor made marvellous use of the British Museum, of which he is the director, to interpret the history of the world through 100 objects. Since the museum owns a fabulous collection of German artefacts C including not one, but two of the original Gutenberg bibles C it makes sense to apply that same method to a country that, at the end of a year of military strutting, we are beginning to view with more respect. 	<br><br>
	
	
Book, radio series, exhibition: it’s not often that three formats have produced such a satisfying and integrated experience. The book, which is magnificently illustrated and superbly edited, occupies the role of a highly superior guide to what is one of the most intelligently planned exhibitions of the year. 	<br><br>
	
	
Irony, while not always apparent in the excellent radio discussions of the selected artefacts, proves key to MacGregor’s written approach. Back in 1970, travellers through Berlin’s Friedrichstrasse Station, offering then the only permitted transit from East to West, were subjected to intrusive scrutiny. 	<br><br>
	
	
A system of mirrors and observation cameras, so strategically situated that a model of the station’s labyrinth was used to train Stasi staff, earned it the sobriquet of Tranenpalast (Palace of Tears). Today, the Friedrichstrasse Station operates without a single surveillance camera. As MacGregor drily notes: “This station is definitely not in Britain.” 	<br><br>
	
	
Ironies abound. It was Hitler who dreamed up the idea of a “people’s car”. Ferdinand Porsche obliged with the Volkswagen Beetle, only to decide that production was economically unviable for the 1,000 Reichsmark price tag insisted upon by his autocratic leader. Shelved, the Beetle would not go on the production line until the post-war years of British occupation. The car’s keenest buyers, the Americans, had a long history of respect for German workmanship. 	<br><br>
Another of MacGregor’s ironic footpaths leads to Weimar, first home of a school of architecture that turned for its inspiration to the guild traditions of the Middle Ages. A photograph shows a beaming Hitler at ease in what appears to be a Bauhaus chair. 	<br><br>
	
The style appealed, but the ethos did not; the Bauhaus, founded by Walter Gropius in 1919, was closed down in 1933. Back then, many of the school’s designs, represented here by Peter Keler’s playfully practical, Kandinsky-coloured rocking cradle, were unmanufacturable. Today, Ikea has inherited the Bauhaus mantle, offering chicly functional and inexpensive mass-produced furniture to a mass audience. 	<br><br>
	
MacGregor reveals an unexpected twist to the Bauhaus tale. In both the show and the book, he displays a replica of the gate into the hell of Buchenwald. Buchenwald had formerly been a weekend haunt for the artists of nearby Weimar. Other Nazi camps presented their mottos (such as Arbeit macht frei) to new arrivals. 	<br><br>
	
At Buchenwald, however, a Bauhaus-trained prisoner, a Communist called Ernst Erhlich, was ordered to create a gate that would speak exclusively to the inmates. Jedem das Seine (“To each his just due”) was the statement that would daily greet the eyes of Dietrich Bonboeffer, Leon Blum and Bruno Bettelheim during their servitude at Buchenwald. 	<br><br>
	
The words, crafted with deliberate art and set within the open and leafy panels of an ironwork gate, would be repainted blood red, year after year. That Cicero’s phrase might fit Buchenwald’s creators and guards better than their victims was a thought unlikely to have escaped the gate’s skilled designer. 	<br><br>
	
One further turn of the screw: released early from captivity, Ehrlich remained in the GDR after the war, as any dedicated Communist might have been expected to do. Only when the immense Stasi archives were opened in 1990 was the discovery made that the architect of Buchenwald’s boldly enigmatic gate had become a meticulous informant and spy. 	<br><br>
	
It’s hard to imagine a method more successful than MacGregor’s C the careful juxtaposition of singular objects with their surrounding history C for conveying the complexities of Germany’s continuing journey away from a shameful past (a past that the post-war nation continues to record in monuments). While a few omissions surprise C might the swastika and its innocuous origins have earned a place? C MacGregor’s selection is largely admirable. 	<br><br>
	
An elaborate Torah bag stitched with the arms of the Holy Roman Emperor, alongside a photograph of leder-hosened Jewish mountain climbers, reminds us that Germany was not always anti-Semitic. Prints of Durer’s valiant knight and his soul-searching companion, Melancholia, usefully sum up the conflicted psyche of Bismarck’s newly united Germany. 	<br><br>
	
It is the sculptures that speak to us more powerfully than even this fine historian’s well-picked words. In 1993, Helmut Kohl selected the sculpted image of a grieving mother as Berlin’s memorial for “The Victims of War and Dictatorship”. The sculptor, Kathe Kollwitz, had lost her only son in the First World War, a war into which she had urged the under-age boy. 	<br><br>
	
Her wooden Pieta shows the mother protecting a child of whom only the upturned face is visible, staring up into hers. “There is no longer pain,” Kollwitz wrote as she carved it in 1937. “Only reflection.” 	<br><br>
	
Back in the Twenties, commemorating that earlier war, the great Ernst Barlach chose Kathe Kollwitz’s face for his Hovering Angel, a mantled bronze that he suspended within the cathedral of his home town, Gustrow. The Nazis, preferring two naked youths with a sword, banished and later destroyed the Barlach Angel. 	<br><br>
	
Today, travelling outside Germany for the first time in 30 years, a second bronze angel, secretly cast from the original plaster, floats above the objects from this book that are currently displayed in London. 	<br><br>
	
Fittingly, MacGregor’s final image is Gerhard Richter’s portrait of his daughter Betty. The girl’s face is turned away from the artist and from us. We are not shown what she sees. We can only guess what she thinks of her father, or his generation. All we know, as MacGregor quietly observes at the end of this timely and profoundly affecting work, is that, in a moment, “this young woman will turn to face us, and the future”. 	<br><br>

Neil MacGregor talks to Simon Schama	<br><br>
	
By Simon Schama	<br><br>
   	
	
There’s no doubting the passion and intellect Neil MacGregor brings to history. So what will he now teach us about a nation with an inescapably explosive past C Germany? 	<br><br>
	
“Suppose,” I say to the director of the British Museum, as we sit in his office, “I want to write the history of Neil MacGregor in three objects. What would they be?” “Golly!” he says, “one never thinks of oneself in those terms.” The animated voice, at once posh and populist, tails off in amused reflection but only for a moment. Then, like the sport he is, he plays the game. “Yoghurt,” he says, decisively, “a pot of Danone yoghurt.”	<br><br>
	
	
	
And then the story of Neil MacGregor: where he came from, what he became, the marvels he makes for British culture, begins.	<br><br>
“My parents” C both Glasgow doctors C “were of that generation completely marked by the war.” For many Britons, that meant a recoil from Europe C but not for MacGregor’s father and mother: “They were absolutely determined I should be brought up as a European.” 	<br><br>
	
And thus, at 10, began the Glasgow boy’s Wanderjahre漫游年 , the making of the roving, endlessly curious, marvellously cosmo-politan mind Britain is lucky enough to have had presiding, successively, over two of its greatest cultural institutions: the National Gallery and the British Museum. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
“I was sent to France, on my own,” to a family in Paris and Arcachon, that lovely Atlantic seaside town south of Bordeaux. There, young Neil had his epiphany with Danone yoghurt and life was never the same. “There was no such thing as yoghurt in Glasgow in the 1950s . . . salt in the porridge, yes, but not yoghurt, much less ‘yow-uhrt’ as I learnt to pronounce it.” A dreamy, happy look comes into his eyes as he intones, as if about to burst into song, “Yaourt, dessert agréable et sain.” “That was the first French phrase I learnt! I wandered happily around Paris by myself, then, back in Glasgow in 1957, I said C hopelessly pretentious as I was and wanting to be somebody else C ‘I just can’t go on without yoghurt.’ My parents took a dim view of this but realised it was their fault for having introduced me to sophistication. There was only one place I could get yoghurt and that was the Jewish delicatessen, so off I went, armed with my pocket money, and that was my first encounter with European Jews.”	<br><br>
	
There in the Glasgow deli, buying yoghurt from the white-aproned Jewish refugee, inhaling the aroma of sausage entirely unrelated to bangers, the boy MacGregor became, heart and soul, a cosmopolitan. That the shopkeepers spoke German was itself unexpectedly thrilling. “In general, in the social hierarchy of Scotland, you didn’t expect shopkeepers to be polyglot.” 	<br><br>
	
. . . 	<br><br>
	
The Glasgow deli C simultaneously Jewish and German, and this just 12 years after the great extermination C was the threshold of a life that would be devoted to the exploration of cultural paradox; to what MacGregor calls “the complication of history”. His own history has not been uncomplicated. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
There in the Glasgow deli, buying yoghurt from a Jewish refugee, the boy MacGregor became, heart and soul, a cosmopolitan	<br><br>
	
After reading French and German at Oxford, he was set to write a thesis at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. The subject was Denis Diderot, the sceptical philosopher and playwright whose omnivorous, encyclopedic intellect and droll temper would have been a perfect match for MacGregor. Instead, he was summoned back by his father to solid professionalism in Scotland: a law degree and then, for some years, practice. It was while he was a lowly apprentice in one of the grandest Glasgow law firms that he remembers one of his young colleagues being told, as a Catholic, that while he was welcomed as an apprentice, he must never dream of making it to a partnership. (He did.)	<br><br>
	
Perhaps it was this sudden revelation of stifling narrowness that sent MacGregor, at the comparatively late age of 27, back to his true calling. While a student of art history at The Courtauld, he received the benediction of Anthony Blunt. From editing The Burlington Magazine he became, at 41, the director of the National Gallery. Over 15 years he wrought a mighty transformation, turning a slightly forbidding cathedral of art into the people’s treasure house without the slightest compromise of aesthetic or scholarly standards. He could work this wonder, as he did again at the British Museum, because in a markedly unBritish way, Neil MacGregor is unafraid to care, and care intensely. And what he cares about most is the museum as more than a lodging house of masterpieces. For MacGregor, the purpose has always been historical and anthropological, to make a place where people rethink their place in the world and rediscover, richly, just what it means to be a human.	<br><br>
	
MacGregor is about to embark on what may be his most challenging exercise yet in cultural education: a 30-part series of weekday programmes for BBC Radio 4, coupled with an exhibition at the British Museum, modelled on the phenomenally successful “History of the World in 100 Objects”. But instead of a Minoan bull-leaper or a Hawaiian feather helmet, this show will feature an Iron Cross, a Gutenberg Bible, the great Tischbein portrait of Goethe, the inscription from the gates of Buchenwald concentration camp and a wetsuit in which fugitives from the Stasi hoped to make it to freedom across the Baltic in a dinghy. For MacGregor’s subject is Germany C from nebulous, scattered, medieval beginnings, via passages of cultural glory and unparalleled brutality, all the way to the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the Berlin Wall and the latest iteration of the protean, endlessly mutating thing that is Germany arriving at the status of the senior power in Europe. 	<br><br>
	
MacGregor senses the project may be a hard sell. He says, a mite defensively C as if anticipating the tabloid headlines “Germans Occupy Bloomsbury, Don’t Mention the War” C “I’ve really no idea whether people are going to be interested. The British, on the whole, don’t travel to Germany and don’t read German literature.” But then he says he also wondered, at the time it was being planned, whether the great Shah ’Abbas Iranian exhibition of 2009 would appeal to the public. “The culture was unfamiliar and there was such a legacy of hostility.” Come, they did, however. 	<br><br>
	
It is just because the public’s general knowledge of German history, such as it is, is so dominated by one immense and hideous narrative C that of the Third Reich and the Holocaust C that MacGregor wants to open minds to something broader and more complex. Those horrors he calls C provocatively C “extraordinary historical anomalies”. What he wants to present to the listener and the visitor to the exhibition is, rather, a strikingly under-determined national identity C one not, from the beginning, driving inexorably on the Autobahn to annihilation. This Germany was more often than not uncertain about what it was, where its borders, especially east and west, lay; a Germany hostile rather than hospitable to centralising power. MacGregor believes this characteristic serves Germany well in its understanding of what a federal Europe needs; when to step in and when to step back. The first section of the exhibition will, he hopes, undermine the stereotypes right away by presenting objects that speak to what he calls “the floating frontier”. The series begins in Konigsberg where, right now, “there is not a single ethnic German”, and the show will include a handcart of the kind pushed by millions of women (for the men were gone) expelled from the eastern lands in 1945 and 1946. Nearly 14 million had to be somehow housed: “It was as though the entire population of Canada or Australia arrived all at once in Britain.” 	<br><br>
	
His own journey to this particular cultural destination also began in the yoghurt-and-sausage years. Hamburg in the early 1960s was the next place in the making of the historically engaged mind-expander. MacGregor was 16, on a school exchange and, like all of us in that generation, most of the Germans he had encountered were the caricatures of war movies, kitted out in SS caps, screaming “Halt!” from watchtowers. In Scotland, his parents had friends who had been prisoners of war who felt that their incarceration was, on the whole, “an honourable recollection”. But it was otherwise in France, where the bitterness and fury were implacable and intense. “There were people one met whose whole family had been deported; there I learnt what it meant to be occupied.” 	<br><br>
	
. . . 	<br><br>
	
Given those preoccupations, the depth of the unhealed wounds, Hamburg was astounding in its silence. “I expected them to talk about their Blitz. The city was almost completely rebuilt C there were still people living in the big old house where I stayed, who had been there since the years when people had to take in the emigrants, but they lived a separate existence on the top floor . . . But at school no one spoke about the war; nicht sprechen. It’s not as if I expected the children to ask, ‘And what did you do in the war Papa?’” C he laughs one of his endearingly self-mocking chuckles C but, “on the borderline between cowardice and courtesy”, he stayed silent for a while too. 	<br><br>
	
Then one day, he realised that the German boys of his own age had no idea that the war had begun when the Reich invaded Poland. “When I did talk to them, they said it had been because Poland attacked Germany!” (More laughter.) No modern history was taught in the German schools. “This didn’t surprise me, because we didn’t do the 20th century in our schools either, so I mentioned it to the teacher and we had a remedial class on it.” MacGregor is at pains to say that this was not a one-boy educational reform project (though the rest of us might say it presaged it): “I was just puzzled.” 	<br><br>
	
The puzzlement deepened in 1969 when, with Rudi Dutschke and the student revolts turning the world upside down, MacGregor understood that this was a generation which had had virtually no access to the history of its calamity and the atrocities it had inflicted on others. And he speaks of their struggles to remake their own history, grounded in truth, as an extraordinary exercise in engagement. I, too, remember Berlin in 1965, when the choices were, on one side of the wall, the oblivion of shopping on the Ku’damm thanks to Chancellor Erhard’s Wirtschaftswunder and, on the other, the fairytales told about valiant communist resistance to the Third Reich and the canonisation of its prewar leader Ernst Thalmann. But among the young, something hungry for truth was seditiously stirring. In Vienna, on the other hand, denial danced in three-four time to a Lehár waltz. 	<br><br>
	
Not so in beleaguered Berlin. There, history, torn from the bed of forgetfulness, was made to be painful, conflicted and guilt-ridden, yet critically important for the possibility of a future life. “There could be no redemption,” MacGregor says. “How could there be?” 	<br><br>
	
	
How did one type of Germany turn into the other? ‘I don’t understand it myself,’ is all MacGregor says	<br><br>
	
But in Germany, history determined how you lived. Arguably it still does. This, he believes, is sharply different from the way in which history is routinely consumed in Britain. This may be about to change as our own country goes through its own painful shape-shift but, mostly, he says, it’s about “good things done in the past”. “It’s in our architecture, our churches . . . a kind of solace,” sometimes on the verge of sentimental self-celebration. German memory, on the other hand, is dangerously, inescapably explosive. From one side of the Siegestor in Munich, the victory arch built in the 1820s, “it looks exactly like Hyde Park Corner, but on the other side it’s completely blown away”. In the very centre of Berlin, in the heart of the capital is, “a monument to ineradicable shame, the Holocaust memorial. I can’t think of any other monument like it in history, a monument to their own shame. Where in Paris is a monument to French imperialism; where in Britain a monument to our own wrongdoings?” There are, I remind him, museums of slavery and empire. “Yes but not in Whitehall,” he says. 	<br><br>
	
Is he worried that his enthusiasm might tip over into vulgar boosterism for the latest edition of democratic Germany; that it will be all Goethe and no Goebbels? “Yes I was C and am.” But it would be hard to accuse MacGregor of running away from the pain and horror, any more than he feels modern Germany itself has done. 	<br><br>
	
There is a huge, hideous anti-semitic poster advertising the “Der Ewige Jude” (The Eternal Jew) exhibition of 1937; and that gate inscription from Buchenwald, “Jedem das Seine” (To each his own). MacGregor’s subtle unpacking of the multiple, hideous ironies of that display is itself worth the price of admission and characteristic of his method. First, an evocation of its setting C the camp just outside Weimar, home both to Goethe and the great burgeoning of free modernism in the 1920s. Then, the physical thing itself, letters of iron assiduously repainted every year by the Nazi regime, so that inmates would have to read it every day from inside the camp parade ground. Then the swerve into unintended resistance: the lettering made in a Bauhaus font by one of its designers, implying the torturers, too, would get their just deserts. And then a succession of twists: the author of that little act of subversion, Franz Ehrlich, released in 1939, goes on to have a flourishing career under the Nazis, and in 1948 Buchenwald is recycled as a communist gulag, where a quarter of the inmates perish.	<br><br>
	
There is a point in the exhibition, he says, from which, in one direction, the visitor will be looking at the beautiful portrait of Goethe by Tischbein C with the great man, a slouch hat on his head, recumbent in the warm light of an Italian landscape, the epitome of humanely learned Germany C while the other direction takes the eye to that Buchenwald inscription. In the Buchenwald essay MacGregor himself raises the awful, essential question of how one kind of Germany turned into the other. But he doesn’t offer an answer: “I don’t understand it myself,” is all he says. 	<br><br>
	
His humility is moving but, all the same, there are ways to try. The Holocaust was made possible precisely because earlier figures who had shaped German culture had dehumanised the Jews and made them objects of murderous hatred. MacGregor wants to present Luther as the father of the German language, and so he was. But what he also fathered, all the more potently for that status, was an obsessive anti-semitism which described the Jews as “full of devil’s feces which they wallow in like swine”. “If they could they would kill us all,” he raved, proposing in On the Jews and their Lies a programme to burn their synagogues and raze their houses, so as to dispose of the “poisonous envenomed worms” that they were. 	<br><br>
	
Luther’s anti-semitism is not in this show. But its illuminations are no less deep for being less relentlessly grim. The Iron Cross, often taken to be the emblem of Prussian militarism, was, he reminds us, invented in a moment of reformist egalitarianism, following the traumatic defeat and humiliation by Napoleon in 1806. Its consequence was to trigger a period of reform. The Cross was iron, not of a precious metal, because it was the first decoration that could be awarded to all ranks. Sanctioned by King Friedrich Wilhelm III, it became the symbol of a new, comradely patriotism. 	<br><br>
The Imperial Crown featured in the exhibition is not the original medieval crown, said to have been worn by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I at his coronation in Rome in 962 and then reused by successive HREs all the way to the liquidation of the empire in that fateful year of 1806. That was the object MacGregor wanted for the show but was “politely” turned down by the Vienna Museum on the understandable grounds that it “doesn’t travel any more”. In an inspired move, MacGregor remembered that Kaiser Wilhelm II’s request had also been declined around 1906, causing the Hohenzollern emperor to make his own version. Showing the replica allows MacGregor to turn the story into a tale of competition for the legacy and memory of Charlemagne, not just between Austrian Habsburgs and Prussian Hohenzollerns but between the Germans and the French.	<br><br>
	
These are the sort of memory riffs, back and forth across time, which MacGregor loves and at which he is the peerless virtuoso. His eyes shine with a boyish glee when he brings off one of those complications which makes us rethink stereotypes. The damage done by mutual tribalism is very much on my mind as I talk, referendum looming, to the Glaswegian who might one day soon become a foreigner to his own country. I ask him whether Germany is a prism through which we can all think harder about what it means to give our allegiance to a national community. He does not take the bait: “I think it’s very sui generis to Germany.”	<br><br>
	
All the same, there is no doubt that he does think of the British Museum as a place with a vocation inherited from its founders like Sir Hans Sloane all the way back in the mid-18th century. Even then that mission was comparative anthropology; the liberating notion that by looking at objects from a range of cultures, separated by geography and history, one would come to understand more about the single object at hand. Sloane collected shoes, all of which had in common the universal need to protect feet but which in every other respect were radically different. “One pair of shoes is not interesting; a huge collection of them an illumination.” 	<br><br>
	
The insatiable curiosity to collect and inquire into other cultures, to learn their languages and understand their traditions in their own terms, was largely pre-imperial, which, he says, makes the museum descended from Sloane “perfectly suited to a postcolonial world”. It was and is the museum which resisted the ignorant assumptions of cultural and racial superiority displayed by the proconsuls and generals of the Victorian empire. MacGregor’s dauntless belief in the humanising effect of looking at the work of others, rather than endlessly at our own reflection caught in the mirror of time, could not be more timely as the fires of wounded nationalisms burn down the house of common culture. 	<br><br>
	
I ask him the question on many people’s minds: it is widely rumoured among the chattering classes that he will not stay much longer in this job. He gives no indication of departure any time soon but smiles and says, “I’ve been here a long time C 12 years.” But then we talk a bit about what kind of exhibition within our own history might have the same salutary effect of raising questions, facing hard truths through the eloquence of objects and he says right away, “Ireland.” 	<br><br>
	
I can’t quite tell whether he has just thought of this or whether he has the next great project already under way. All I know, as I step out into Great Russell Street under a kindly drizzle, forgetting that, in the brightness of our voluble conversation, we only got to one of the three objects in the history of MacGregor, is that times being what they are, neither the British Museum, nor whatever is left of the house of Britain itself, can afford to do without Neil MacGregor. 	<br><br>

 Making us human, 2,000,000 - 9000 BC<br><br>
Human life began in Africa. Here our ancestors created the first stone tools to chop meat, bones and wood. It is this ability to make objects that allowed humans to adapt to a multitude of environments and spread into the Middle East, Europe and Asia. From about 40,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, humans created the world’s first representational art. The Ice Age also caused the world’s sea levels to fall exposing a landbridge between Siberia and Alaska. This allowed humans to reach the Americas for the first time and rapidly spread across the continent.

After the Ice Age: food and sex, 9000 - 3500 BC<br><br>
The development of farming occurred independently in at least seven different parts of the world at the end of the last Ice Age around 10,000 years ago. This slow revolution took many centuries and had profound implications on how humans lived. Tending crops and domesticating animals meant that humans had to settle in one place for the first time. Farming also created a food surplus that allowed larger groups of people to live together. This led to the formation of the first villages. Farming not only changed how people lived but how they thought. New gods were created to explain animal behaviour, fertility and the seasonal cycles of crops.<br><br>

The First Cities and States, 4000 - 2000 BC<br><br>
The world’s first cities and states emerged in the river valleys of North Africa and Asia about 6000C5000 years ago. For the first time people came together to live in settlements larger than villages. In these communities there is evidence of kings, rulers and great differences in power and wealth. These changes took place in what is today Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan and India. But there are important differences between the early cities and states in these three regions. The world’s earliest writing also developed during this period. The surviving records of early writing are almost all administrative lists.<br><br>

The Beginning of Science and Literature, 1500 - 700 BC<br><br>
The development of cities and states in different parts of the world had many important consequences. Two of these were the world’s earliest written literature and the development of scientific and mathematical knowledge. These states often fought each other, and rulers sought to demonstrate their success and power over their subjects through the creation of impressive monuments. Early societies did not exist in isolation, but were connected through extensive trade networks by road and also by sea. Although the majority of the world’s population lived in small villages, these people were also capable of creating sophisticated objects, monuments and cultures.

Old World, New Powers, 1100 - 300 BC<br><br>
Around 3000 years ago new powers and peoples arose across the world, often replacing existing powers. Egypt was challenged by its former subject peoples from Sudan. In Iraq a rising military power, the Assyrians, constructed a new empire across the Middle East. In China, a group of outsiders, the Zhou, overthrew the long established Shang dynasty. The struggle for power and resources brought about economic change. In both the Middle East and China, coins were created and used for the first time. Meanwhile South America’s first cities and complex societies began to emerge.

The World in the Age of Confucius, 500 - 300 BC<br><br>
Classical Greece is often regarded as a golden age in western civilisation. However, this was not only an important period in European history. Across the world different cultures were creating their own visions of society that would remain influential for thousands of years. During this period, Socrates lectured the people of Athens, while Confucius taught his political philosophy in China. In Central America the Olmecs created the sophisticated calendars, religion and art that would characterise future Central American civilisations until the European conquest. The Persians created the first global superpower spanning three continents. In northern Europe many tribes shared a common language. This formed the basis for the creation of a modern Celtic identity.<br><br>

Empire Builders, 300 BC - AD 1<br><br>
Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire in 334 BC ushered in an age of megalomaniac rulers and great empires. Although there had been individual empires before, this was the first time superpowers spanned the globe. Alexander became a model for other rulers to emulate or reject. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, imitated Alexander by using his own image to represent imperial power to his subjects. In contrast, the Emperor Ashoka rejected authoritarian rule, promoting his peaceful philosophy through inscriptions on pillars across the Indian subcontinent. While Ashoka’s ideals did not last long beyond his lifetime, the Roman Empire continued for the next 400 years. It was only rivalled in size and population by the Han dynasty in China.<br><br>

Ancient Pleasures, Modern Spice, AD 1 - 600<br><br>
In traditional models of Chinese history decadence and luxury are associated with periods of decline. The collapse of the Han dynasty into the chaotic Period of Disunion was partly blamed on emperors succumbing to the pleasures of court life. Similarly in Rome intellectuals worried that the taste for luxury goods from the east, like pepper, would bankrupt the empire. Attitudes to pleasure, luxury and leisure fluctuate throughout history. For example the relationships between boys and older men tolerated in the Roman Empire would be deemed illegal today. Many of our modern leisure activities have their origins in ancient religions. Tobacco smoking and some of the earliest team sports first occurred in the Americas, where they were used in religious rituals.

The Rise of World Faiths, AD 200 - 600<br><br>
A small number of major faiths have shaped the world over the last 2000 years. The iconography and other key features of Buddhism, Christianity and Hinduism all developed within a few hundred years of each other. Buddhism first began to allow images of the Buddha in human form from AD 100 to 200, while the oldest images of Jesus Christ coincide with the acceptance of Christianity as the predominant religion of the Roman Empire in AD 312. At a similar time, Hinduism developed out of the Vedic religion in Gupta India. The birth of the Prophet Mohammad in AD 570 set the scene for the rise of Islam, which eventually replaced Zoroastrianism in Iran and the earlier religions of Arabia.

The Silk Road And Beyond, AD 400 - 700<br><br>
The Silk Road from China to Europe was at its peak between AD 500 and 800, the time of the so-called ‘Dark Ages’ in Western Europe. This trade route connected a revived Tang China with the newly formed Islamic Caliphate, which conquered the Middle East and North Africa. It was not only people and goods that spread along the Silk Road but also ideas. Buddhism spread from India into China along the Silk Road and also into the newly formed kingdom of Korea. Silk Road products even made their way to remote Britain, as shown by the South Asian gems found in the Sutton Hoo burial. Meanwhile the first organised states in South America were beginning to flourish.

Inside The Palace: Secrets At Court, AD 700 - 950<br><br>
Week 11 explores life inside the courts of the elites between AD 700 and 900. While the Maya were flourishing in the Americas, two other great powers: Tang China and the Islamic Empire were also at their peak. A large part of Europe was briefly united under the rule of the Emperor Charlemagne, before it fragmented into individual, squabbling states. The great powers of Eurasia were connected by maritime trade across the Indian Ocean, which fuelled a booming world economy. Objects from the hearts of these courts, provide an insight into how rulers viewed themselves and the world they were creating.

Pilgrims, Raiders and Traders, AD 900 - 1300<br><br>
Medieval Europe was not isolated from Africa and Asia, pilgrims and merchants regularly criss-crossed between the continents carrying with them goods and ideas. The Scandinavian Vikings travelled and traded from Greenland to Central Asia. In the Indian Ocean a vast maritime trade network connected Africa, the Middle East, India and China. Buddhism and Hinduism had spread along these trade routes from India to Indonesia. Even the Crusades did not prevent trade flourishing between Christian Europe and the Islamic World. In contrast, Japan, under the Heian dynasty, chose to isolate itself, closing off relationships with its neighbour China for the next 300 years.

Status Symbols, AD 1200 - 1400<br><br>
Objects have always been used by the wealthy and powerful as status symbols, but such objects could not be created without skilled and knowledgeable craftsworkers. Technological advances during this period fuelled the creation of magnificent objects across the world. Iconic blue-and-white porcelain was first developed in Mongol-ruled China, and went on to be desired across the globe. In Ife, one of the first city-states to arise in West Africa, artists created lifelike sculptures using sophisticated bronze working techniques. Within the Islamic world arts and sciences flourished and European scholars soon benefited from Islamic advances in astronomy, maths and even chess. A ruler’s status in the Caribbean was closely tied to their relationship with their ritual throne.

Meeting The Gods, AD 1200 - 1400<br><br>
Throughout the world during this period objects were used to bring the faithful closer to their gods. In the Western Church, pilgrims flocked to shrines to see holy relics, including the bodyparts of saints. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, images of Jesus and the saints were venerated in the form of icons. Hindu worshipers in India used statues to developing a personal relationship with individual Hindu gods. In Huastec Mexico, penitents visited statues of the mother goddess asking for forgiveness. The religion of Easter Islanders in the Pacific changed to reflect their deteriorating environment. Polynesians ceased worshiping statues of their ancestors and instead created a cult associated with the island’s diminishing bird population.

The Threshold of the Modern World, AD 1375 - 1550<br><br>
In about 1450 a string of great empires dominated the world. The Ottoman Turks were threatening Europe with invasion. Asia was dominated by Ming China and the Timurid Empire, but the world’s largest state was the Inca Empire in South America. Europe, in contrast, was a patchwork of squabbling powers. Yet there were the first signs of a shift towards a connection of all the world’s continents by European exploration that would mark the beginning of a recognisably modern world. These new maritime empires brought Europe’s fragmented kingdoms great wealth. The rhinoceros that inspired Durer’s iconic print was a present from an Indian Sultan to a Portuguese governor.

The First Global Economy, AD 1450 - 1600<br><br>
Europe’s expanding maritime empire created the world’s first global economy. Spanish pieces of eight were used as currency from the new world of the Americas to Japan. The Dutch East India Company was a multinational conglomeration transporting goods from the Far East to a European market. Different cultures were brought into contract for the first time with varying results. When Spanish explorers arrived in Mexico it led to the destruction of the Aztec Empire. In contrast, the relationship between the Portuguese and the kingdom of Benin was mutually beneficial, with Portuguese sailors providing much-desired brass in exchange for ivory and palm oil.<br><br>

Tolerance and Intolerance, AD 1550 - 1700<br><br>
The Protestant Reformation split the western Church into two rival factions and triggered Europe’s final major religious war. The failure of either side to achieve victory in the Thirty Years War would lead to a period of religious tolerance in Europe. Three great Islamic powers dominated Eurasia: the Ottomans in Turkey, the Mughals in India and the Safavids in Iran. The Mughals promoted religious tolerance, allowing the Indian subcontinent’s largely non-Islamic population to continue to worship as they pleased. In Iran the Safavids created the world’s first major Shi’i state. Exploration and trade provided opportunities for religions to attract new followers. Catholicism in Central America and Islam in South East Asia both adapted to accommodate the existing rituals of their new converts.

Exploration, Exploitation and Enlightenment, AD 1680 - 1820<br><br>
The Enlightenment (1680C1820) was an age in which scientific learning and philosophy flourished. Although often associated with reason, liberty and progress, the Enlightenment was also a period of European imperial expansion when the transatlantic slave trade was at its height. Important advances in navigation allowed European sailors to explore the Pacific more thoroughly, and for the first time the indigenous cultures of Hawaii and Australia were connected with the rest of the world. Europe was not the world’s only successful growing economy, China, under the Qing dynasty, was regarded by many as the greatest empire the world had ever seen.<br><br>

Mass Production, Mass Persuasion, AD 1780 - 1914<br><br>
Between the French Revolution and the First World War the countries of Europe and the USA were transformed from agricultural to industrial economies. At the same time, their empires around the world grew. Technological innovation led to the mass production of goods and growing international trade. Previously luxuries, like tea and Wedgewood pottery, became affordable to the masses. In many countries, movements pressed for political and social reforms, including the right for all men and women to be able to vote. The industrial revolutions of the West were partly funded by resources from Europe’s expanding colonial empires. Only one non-western country, Japan, successfully embraced modernisation and emerged as an imperial power in its own right.

The World of Our Making, AD 1914 - 2010<br><br>
The 20th century saw objects used to express the power of totalitarian regimes, the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the end of Europe’s colonial empires. Technological innovations have changed the way we relate to each other and the material world. The invention of man-made materials like plastic resulted in mass production and consumption on an unprecedented scale. More objects have been produced in the last 100 years than ever before. Yet many of these new objects are ephemeral and disposable. This raises questions about the environment, global resources, and sustainability. But, as has been true for almost two million years, the objects we use today to face these challenges will go on to reveal our history to future generations.<br><br>

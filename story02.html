	<hr><br>

Mummy and coffins of Hornedjitef an Egyptian priest who lived over 1,000 years after Tutankhamun and Ramesses the Great.
<br><br>

This is the mummy of Hornedjitef an Egyptian priest who was buried in a coffin, within a second, outer coffin. Examining his body using CAT scans and X-rays revealed that he suffered from arthritis and osteoporosis suggesting he was a mature man when he died. The embalmers have placed four packages inside his torso, probably his lungs, liver, stomach and intestines. He lived over a thousand years after Tutankhamun and Ramesses the Great at a time when Egypt was ruled by Greek kings.
<br><br>
Why did the Egyptians mummify their dead?
<br><br>
When ancient Egyptians like Hornedjitef died they believed they were setting off on a journey from this world to the afterlife. The process of mummification, spells and elaborate coffins enabled them to travel to the next world. This coffin is decorated with images of gods and extracts from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. A figure of the sky goddess Nut is painted on the interior of this coffin. This symbolically locates Hornedjitef in the womb of the goddess, ready to experience rebirth.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">2. Olduvai stone chopping tool</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
A 1.8 million year old stone tool, the oldest object in the British Museum. It was used to chop bones, plants and wood.
<br><br>
This chopping tool is the oldest humanly made object in the British Museum. It could be used for many purposes including chopping bones, plants and wood. By using a stone hammer to knock flakes off of a pebble our ancestors could make a tool with a sharp, functional edge. Olduvai is part of the great East African Rift Valley torn open by massive earthquakes. Many skulls and bones of our early ancestors have been found along this valley.
<br><br>
Can we be human without objects?<br><br>

The invention of the first tools is one of the most important moments in human history. Making, using and sharing things played a key role in developing human behaviour. The ability to make tools allowed humans to adapt to new environments and out-compete other animals. Gradually it would lead to humans becoming the most successful animal in the world. All modern technology began with these first chopping tools.

	<hr><br>
	
3. Olduvai handaxe<br><br>

This handaxe made of green volcanic lava represents a tradition of tool-making which began about 1.6 million years ago. Smaller handaxes became common handheld tools used for cutting meat or woodworking. Produced with great skill by ancestors we would recognize as becoming human, this object shows that manufactured things, sometimes of distinctive quality, were starting to be important in the evolution of our behaviour.
<br><br>
Humans spread out of Africa
<br><br>
The makers of handaxes are the first humans to spread across Africa into Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Handaxes reflect the first great spread of humankind and the establishment of a way of life in which we recognize the beginnings of our human characteristics. No other humanly made object has ever been manufactured over such a long period and before the 20th century no other object has spread over such a wide geographical area.

<a href= "pic01.html">Swimming reindeer</a><br><br>


Ice Age carving of two swimming reindeer made from the tip of a mammoth’s tusk.
<br><br>
This sculpture of two swimming reindeer is one of the oldest works of art in the British Museum. It was carved from the tip of a mammoth tusk and made during an extraordinary period of artistic creativity during the last Ice Age. Such works of art could be carried around, bringing images found in the great painted caves of Europe into the daylight. These Ice Age artists were fully modern people with the same mental abilities as humans today.
<br><br>
What was Ice Age art used for?
<br><br>
The artist has depicted the reindeer as they look in autumn. At this time of year the meat, skin and antlers are at their best for use as food, clothing and materials for making equipment. Showing the reindeer swimming may suggest migration or a moment when the animals were easy prey for their human hunters. Was this sculpture a means of communicating with the supernatural world or a charm to guarantee a successful hunt at the start of a bitterly cold Ice Age winter?

	<b><a name="T6">5. Clovis spear point</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Spear point made by some of the earliest people to migrate to America C used to hunts mammoths, horses and giant bison.
<br><br>
The first clear evidence of human activity in North America are spear heads like this. They are called Clovis points. These spear tips were used to hunt large game. The period of the Clovis people coincides with the extinction of mammoths, giant sloth, camels and giant bison in North America. The extinction of these animals was caused by a combination of human hunting and climate change.<br><br>

How did humans reach America?<br><br>

North America was one of the last continents in the world to be settled by humans after about 15,000 BC. During the last Ice Age, water, which previously flowed off the land into the sea, was frozen up in vast ice sheets and glaciers so sea levels dropped. This exposed a land bridge that enabled humans to migrate through Siberia to Alaska. These early Americans were highly adaptable and Clovis points have been found throughout North America.

	<b><a name="T7">6. Bird-shaped pestle</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Bird-shaped pestle used by early farming communities in Papua New Guinea, more than 4,000 years ago.
<br><br>
This bird-shaped pestle was used by early farmers in Papua New Guinea, probably to grind the vegetable taro in a mortar. People in Papua New Guinea learnt how to grow crops 9000 years ago. Papua New Guinea was one of seven locations where farming independently developed after the last Ice Age. The pestle’s long neck meant it was too delicate to be used regularly and its bird-shape suggests it may have been used for pounding food on special occasions.
<br><br>
When did humans start to farm?<br><br>

Growing plants and raising animals is one of the most important developments in human history. It was a gradual change that took place over several thousand years about 10,000 years ago. Farming created an abundant food supply that for the first time could support larger populations. People began to settle in one place to grow crops rather than being constantly on the move searching for new food sources. This led to the creation of the first villages.

	<b><a name="T8">7. Ain Sakhri lovers figurine</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The world’s earliest representation of a couple having sex. This figure is about 11,000 years old.
<br><br>
This is the oldest known representation of a couple making love in the world. It was found in a cave in the Judean desert. The pebble depicts a couple face to face. One person has wrapped their arms around the shoulders of their lover in an embrace. The knees of one of the figures bend up over the legs of the other. The pebble has been ingeniously carved so that, whichever way you look at it, the shape of the figurine is phallic but the genders of the couple are not revealed.
<br><br>
What was the sculpture used for?<br><br>

The people who made the figurine are known as Natufians and are among the first people to domesticate sheep and goats. Selectively breeding animals required an understanding of the male role in reproduction and the sculpture's phallic shape may reflect their interest in fertility. Was this work of art used for rituals focussed on fertility or is it simply a reflection on human love?<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">8. Egyptian clay model of cattle</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
A model of four cattle buried in a grave in Egypt, African descendants of cows first tamed after the Ice Age.

<br><br>

This clay model of four cows was made in Egypt over 5000 years ago. It was placed in a grave, perhaps to provide its owner with food in the afterlife. Cows were revered in Egypt as a source of life in the harsh desert environment and whole cows were sometimes also buried with people. Later they were worshipped as the cow goddess Bat - the protector and mother of the pharaoh.
<br><br>
When were cows first domesticated?
<br><br>
Cows were first domesticated in North Africa in 8000 BC. After the Ice Age the earth had grown warmer and the lush savannah was transformed into the Sahara desert. As the climate became drier people became restricted to the Nile valley, where they relied on cows for food and as beasts of burden to carry water. Cows were also domesticated independently in the Middle East and today all cattle across the World are descendents of these Middle Eastern cows.

<a href= "pic02.html">9. Maya maize god statue</a><br><br>


The statue is of the Mayan maize god. He was found in a pyramid-style temple in Copan in modern-day Honduras surrounded by many other maize gods. In Mayan mythology, the maize god was decapitated at harvest time but reborn again at the beginning of a new growing season. Myths about the death and rebirth of gods helped explain the cycle of the seasons and the return of maize, on which Mayan civilisation depended.<br><br>

Why did the Mayans worship maize?<br><br>

The myth of the maize god is just one example of how the development of agriculture led to major changes in how people across the world conceived their gods. For thousands of years the Mayans worshiped the maize god and believed that their ancestors were made from maize dough. Maize was the Mayan's most important food source. Today maize still forms a large part of the Central American diet in the form of tortillas.

	<hr><br>
	
One of the earliest pots in the world made to boil food by hunter gatherers in Japan about 7,000 years ago.
<br><br>
Jomon pots are the oldest pots in the world. Pottery was invented by people living in Japan, China and Korea during the last Ice Age about 14,000 years ago. Pots allowed people to boil foods such as nuts and shellfish to make them edible. This complete pot was found thousands of years after it was made and put to a new use. During the 1800s the inside was lined with gold foil and lacquered for use in Japanese tea ceremonies.
<br><br>
How did hunter gatherers make pots?<br><br>

It was once thought that the first pots were invented by farmers. The nomadic lifestyle of hunter-gatherers meant that they were unable to carry pots. The Jomon were hunter-gatherers however, and were able to develop pottery because of Japan's unique environment. They lived in a particularly food rich area - their diet contained over 65 different mammal species. This allowed the Jomon to settle in one place for several years and encouraged the development of pottery for cooking food.<br><br>

<a href= "pic03.html">11. King Den’s sandal label</a><br><br>
	
Label made from hippopotamus ivory and attached to the sandals of the Egyptian ruler Pharaoh Den.
<br><br>
The figure holding a mace on this hippopotamus ivory label is King Den. He was a member of the first dynasty of rulers that united Egypt into a single state. This label was attached to one of Den's sandals and placed in his tomb when he died. In front of Den a much smaller enemy cowers. Hieroglyphs on the label celebrate, 'the first occasion of smiting the east'. They refer to King Den's military conquests in Sinai, eastern Egypt.
<br><br>
Why did civilisation develop in Egypt?<br><br>

The world's first states and cities developed in river valleys. Along the Nile in Egypt the annual flooding created a fertile valley and delta ideal for growing crops. Egypt's individual towns were unified and governed by a single king, described in later times by the title 'pharaoh'. The pharaoh, however, was more than just a leader; he was also a representative of the gods and the focus for the state's religion. Egypt would be ruled by pharaohs for the next 3000 years.

<a href= "pic04.html">12. Standard of Ur</a><br><br>
	
The Standard of Ur is from one of the world’s first cities. It shows scenes from the life of a king of Ur in ancient Iraq.
<br><br>
What the Standard of Ur was used for remains a mystery but it seems to have royal connections. It was buried in a royal grave and depicts two contrasting scenes of a king of Ur - identifiable as larger than the other figures. On one side captured enemy prisoners are presented to the king by his soldiers. On the other side the king enjoys a ceremonial banquet accompanied by lyre music. 
<br><br>
Where did the first cities develop?
<br><br>
Ur in Mesopotamia was one of the earliest cities in the world. The Greek word Mesopotamia means the land between the rivers and Ur was one of many cities that developed in the fertile plains between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Unlike Egypt at this time, these cities were not unified into a single state but were individual self-governing centres of power. They were ruled by kings and contained palaces, temples and sophisticated irrigation systems.

<a href= "pic05.html">13. Indus seal</a><br><br>
	
Seal used for making impressions that led to the discovery of the Indus civilisation in Pakistan and India.
<br><br>
This seal was found in the 1870s and led to the discovery of an ancient civilisation in the Indus Valley. It was probably used to close documents and mark packages of goods. This suggests that the Indus civilisation was part of an extensive long-distance trading network. The animal on this seal was originally mistaken for a unicorn but is now thought to be a bull. The seals carry the oldest writing in South Asia. It has yet to be deciphered.
<br><br>
What was the Indus Civilisation?
<br><br>
The earliest civilisation in South Asia developed along the Indus river and India's western coast. The Indus civilisation produced writing, built large cities and controlled food production through a central government. Unlike Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Indus civilisation was not dominated by powerful religious elites. No temples were built and no images of state gods or kings have been found. Deforestation, climate change and a series of invasions all contributed to the Indus civilisation's decline in 1500 BC.

	<hr><br>
	
A 5,000 year old polished stone axe found in Canterbury but made in the Alps.
<br><br>
This jade axe is highly polished and would have taken hours to make. However, it is unmarked and was not used to cut wood. It was probably a luxury status symbol, indicating its owner's power and prestige. Jade is not found in Britain and this axe was made from a boulder high in the Italian Alps. It was possibly traded through Brittany in France and then arrived in England as an object of ceremony or ritual.
<br><br>
How were axes used for farming?
<br><br>
The polished stone axe was a revolutionary tool that transformed society and the landscape after the Ice Age. At the time Northern Europe was covered in thick forest. Stone axes set in wooden handles allowed people to clear space to plant crops and graze domestic animals. The earliest known British farmers came from other parts of Europe, crossing the sea with their animals and seed in small boats. These people later constructed stone monuments at Avebury and the first Stonehenge.

<a href= "pic06.html">15. Early writing tablet</a><br><br>
	
Clay tablet from the ancient Middle East with some of the world’s earliest writing - a record of workers' beer rations.
<br><br>
This piece of clay contains some of the earliest writing in the world. It's called 'cuneiform,' which means wedge-shaped. This tablet is a record of the daily beer rations for workers. Beer here is represented by an upright jar with a pointed base. The symbol for rations is a human head eating from a porridge bowl. The round and semicircular impressions represent the measurements. All the signs were produced by a cut reed.
<br><br>
When did writing develop?
<br><br>
The oldest known example of writing comes from Mesopotamia and dates to about 3300 BC. In time different-looking writing appeared in the river valleys of Egypt, the Indus Valley, China and Central America. We cannot yet be certain whether writing spread from Mesopotamia, or developed independently in these civilisations. As Mesopotamian society became more complex, writing allowed administrators to keep an account of who had been paid and what had been traded. The earliest cuneiform tablets are almost all records of accountancy.

	<b><a name="T17">16. Flood Tablet</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Clay tablet that caused a sensation in Victorian England. It tells the story of a flood myth from the epic of Gilgamesh.
<br><br>
This Assyrian tablet tells the story of a plan by the gods to destroy the world by means of a great flood. Ut-napishti, like the biblical Noah, builds a huge boat to rescue his family and every type of animal. When this tablet was first translated in 1872 it caused a sensation. How could the similarity between the Mesopotamian myth and the biblical Flood story be explained?
<br><br>
A piece of the world's oldest literature
<br><br>
Mesopotamian poets had told versions of the story of the flood for 2,000 years before this tablet was written for King Ashurbanipal's Library. This version is part of the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh - the first great epic of world literature. Gilgamesh is a hero who sets off on a quest for immortality. He battles with monsters and ultimately must confront his own nature and mortality.

	<b><a name="T18">17. Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
An ancient Egyptian papyrus used by scribes C it contains 84 mathematical problems.
<br><br>
This is the most famous mathematical papyrus to have survived from Ancient Egypt. It contains 84 different mathematical problems - such as how to distribute 100 loaves of bread among a workforce in different ratios. Such skills were constantly needed by scribes - the administrators of the Egyptian society. This papyrus was placed in its owner's tomb as a sign of his highly educated status. Papyrus documents are made from the papyrus reed, which is common in the Nile valley but relatively expensive.
<br><br>
Why did maths first develop?
<br><br>
Complex societies like Egypt required maths to create buildings, manage food supplies and compute the flood levels of the Nile. The Egyptians were renowned by the Greeks as masters of geometry. However, very little evidence of complex Egyptian mathematics survives. Mathematics also developed in Mesopotamia, including the system of dividing time into units of 60 that is still used today for minutes and seconds. Higher maths, such as deductive reasoning and logic, developed in Greece from 500 BC onwards.

	<hr><br>
	
A bronze statue of an acrobat leaping over a bull from the island of Crete.
<br><br>
This bronze figurine depicts a man somersaulting over a bull. It comes from the island of Crete and was probably used in a shrine or a cave sanctuary. Bulls were the largest animals on Crete and were of great social significance. Bull jumping was probably performed during religious ceremonies, although a leap such as this would have been almost impossible. In Greek myth, Crete was the home of the labyrinth and the fearsome Minotaur - half bull and half man.
<br><br>
Who were the Minoans?
<br><br>
The Minoan people of Crete built magnificent palaces, developed systems of writing and were able to make tools and sculptures from bronze. Crete had no natural sources of copper or tin to make bronze however, and relied on an extensive maritime trade network to obtain these materials. The Minoans were proficient sailors and traded with Egypt, Greece and the Middle East. Trade also spread Minoan ideas and art around the Eastern Mediterranean.

	<hr><br>
	
Gold cape made almost 4,000 years ago for a slim woman or child and found in a grave in North Wales.

<br><br>
This gold cape was originally found in a grave in North Wales. It has been crafted from a single gold ingot beaten to a breathtakingly thin sheet. We do not know who wore the cape but it could only fit a slim woman or child. Whoever wore it must also have possessed great power and wealth. This wealth may have been generated by the nearby Great Orme - the largest copper mine in north-west Europe. This would have been a major trading centre for prehistoric communities.
<br><br>
How did people live in Bronze Age Britain?
<br><br>
When this gold cape was made people in Britain did not live in permanent villages, nor did they build cities or palaces. Bronze Age Britons lived in socially fluid communities moving with their herds and possessions through the landscape, burying their dead in round barrows. Despite not living in cities or a state they were capable of creating incredibly sophisticated objects like the Mold Gold Cape. Individual communities were connected by an extensive trade network that spanned north-west Europe.

	<hr><br>
<a href= "pic07.html">20. Statue of Ramesses II</a><br><br>
	
Colossal statue of Ramesses II, one of ancient Egypt’s most famous and successful pharaohs.
<br><br>

This statue of the Pharaoh Ramesses II was designed to show him as a beneficent ruler, a mighty warrior and a living god. It was erected in the Ramesseum - his mortuary temple, where the cult of Ramesses would continue for centuries. During his reign the annual Nile flood repeatedly reached ideal levels leading to good harvests and a period of prosperity in Egypt. Ramesses himself fathered 85 children with a number of queens during his 66-year reign.
<br><br>
Why was Ramesses II so successful?
<br><br>
Ramesses II is known as one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs - nine further pharaohs tried to emulate his success by taking his name. Although Ramesses was renowned as a warrior-king he suffered several military setbacks. Ramesses owed his reputation to his skills as a self-publicist - he erected more statues than any other Egyptian pharaoh. He even changed or added to the inscriptions on previous pharaohs' statues to glorify himself. This ensured that Ramesses was worshiped as a god for centuries after his death.

	<hr><br>
	
Stone carvings from King Sennacherib of Assyria's palace, showing his army attacking the town of Lachish near Jerusalem.
<br><br>


The Lachish relief depicts the Assyrian army laying siege in 701 BC to the town of Lachish, about 40 kilometres from Jerusalem. Soldiers storm the town walls while prisoners are marched out of the town into exile. The relief was created for the walls of the great palace of the Assyrian king, Sennacherib, in Nineveh. Such scenes demonstrated the consequences of rebelling against the Assyrian empire. Sennacherib is shown as an invincible king presiding over a perfect victory.
<br><br>
Were the Assyrians war-like?
<br><br>
The Assyrians were renowned for their military successes yet they initially developed a strong army as a means to defend themselves. The Assyrian heartland has no natural defences and was vulnerable to attack. Soon the Assyrians had conquered an empire stretching from Egypt to Iran. Lachish was just one city that fell in a long series of wars that saw many people shifted from their homelands and put to work on such projects as building Sennacherib's palace.

	<hr><br>
	
A sphinx with the black African face of Pharaoh Taharqo of Kush in Sudan, which ruled Egypt for about 100 years.

<br><br>

Sphinxes are traditional Egyptian icons but this sphinx has the face of a Sudanese man. It is modelled on the face of King Taharqo - one of the greatest leaders of the kingdom of Kush in modern-day Sudan. Taharqo was one of several Kushite pharaohs to rule Egypt. They created a hybrid identity combining Kushite and Egyptian traditions in order to govern their new empire. The two cobras on the headdress may signify that Taharqo ruled two kingdoms - Kush and Egypt.
<br><br>
How did Sudan conquer Egypt?
<br><br>
For thousands of years Egypt exploited the raw materials of Kush but in 728 BC the balance of power changed. Egypt had become fragmented and the Kushites marched north and captured city after city. The Kushite pharaohs imposed a strong government in Egypt, pursued an active foreign policy and stimulated a revival in art, architecture and religious practices. The Kushite reign in Egypt came to the end after they were defeated by the Assyrians.

	<hr><br>
	
A Chinese bronze vessel used for making ritual offerings of food to ancestors.


<br><br>
This ritual vessel was used for offering food to ancestors. This example is decorated with large tusked animal heads swallowing birds. Sacrifices to ancestors ensured the survival and success of those who performed them. Respect for ancestors has been a central part of Chinese life for thousands of years. This vessel was made through sophisticated bronze working techniques that were not employed in the Middle East or Europe until much later.
<br><br>
What is the legacy of the Zhou dynasty in China?
<br><br>
An inscription inside the vessel describes an attack by the Zhou king on the dynasty they overthrew - the Shang. Many of China's significant institutions were established during the Zhou period. Most important is the mandate of heaven - the notion that heaven blesses the authority of a just ruler. An incompetent ruler could be displaced by the people with the favour of the gods. This would become a central aspect of Chinese politics.

	<hr><br>
	
These pieces of cloth, made by the Paracas civilisation in ancient South America, were found wrapped around a mummified body.


<br><br>
These textile fragments are made of alpaca or llama wool and would originally have been part of a cloak. They depict flying shamans grasping human heads in their talons. The bottom figure carries a knife used to behead his victim. They were found wrapped around mummified bodies in the great Paracas Necropolis in Peru. These 2000-year-old textiles were preserved in the dry, dark conditions of the tomb.
<br><br>
Who were the Paracas cultures?
<br><br>
The Paracas textiles come from a period in South American history when crops, llamas and guinea pigs were first domesticated and distinct social classes emerged for the first time. Textiles were valued by the Paracas above all other things and they were worn to indicate status and authority. Some textiles were over 34 metres long and would have required large numbers of people and complex organization to make. The Paracas and other contemporary communities laid the foundations for the later societies of the Andes, including the Inca.

	<b><a name="T26">25. Gold coin of Croesus </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
One of the world’s earliest coins minted in ancient Turkey about 2,500 years ago.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic08.html">25. Gold coin of Croesus</a><br><br>


These are some of the world's first coins, produced in Lydia, western Turkey, over 2500 years ago. The lion on this coin is seen as a symbol of royalty. The two deep impressions were created by a hammer, used to punch the image of the lion and bull into the blank coin. Lydia was renowned for its wealth and its last king, Croesus, was immortalized in the saying 'as rich as Croesus.'
<br><br>
Why did people invent money?
<br><br>
Cities and empires managed without coins for over 2000 years. Electrum (gold and silver mixture) was used for the first coins, but coinage gained popularity when gold and silver coins were introduced. Coinage probably developed in Lydia because it was a trading centre and possessed large gold supplies. Before coins, payments were made with metal bullion or by barter. To establish its value metal was checked for purity and weighed. The Lydians minted coins of consistent weight and purity to speed up transactions.

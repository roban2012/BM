	<b><a name="T1">76. The mechanical galleon</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Clockwork automated model of a galleon, designed to move along a grand table during a banquet.

<br><br>

This mechanical galleon is in fact an elaborate, automated clock. Its mechanism no longer works but originally it would have played music, fired its cannons and trundled across the table at imperial banquets. Clocks like this were important status symbols in the courts of Europe in the 1500s and this clock is based on the great European ships that sailed the oceans during this period. It is unlikely that the clock's creator, Hans Schlottheim in inland Germany, ever saw an actual galleon.
<br><br>
Who is the figure in the throne?
<br><br>
The Holy Roman Emperor is the central figure on this galleon. He is surrounded by seven noblemen known as the Electors, who were responsible for selecting the emperor. When the galleon was made the Holy Roman Emperor was Rudolf II, a member of the powerful Hapsburg family. A galleon was an appropriate symbol for the emperor's power as much of the Hapsburgs' wealth came from silver brought back from the Americas. Mechanical automata were often used as diplomatic gifts and the Hapsburgs gave clocks to the Turkish sultan to maintain peaceful relationships throughout the 1500s.

	<b><a name="T2">77. Benin plaque: the oba with Europeans</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Brass plaque showing the Oba (king) of Benin in West Africa with attendants and European traders.

<br><br>

The figure at the centre of this brass plaque is the oba - the king of Benin in Nigeria. In the background on either side of the oba are two tiny figures, identified as Portuguese traders, characterised by their long hair and European-style hats. Two attendants kneel beside the oba, indicating the hierarchical nature of royal power in Benin. In pre-Colonial times the king was regarded as the highest political and religious authority and respected as the representative of the ancestors.
<br><br>
How did European brass spark an artistic renaissance in Benin?
<br><br>
The kingdom of Benin dominated trade with Europeans on the Nigerian coast from the late 1400s to the end of the 1900s. When Portuguese traders arrived in Benin in the 1400s they brought brass bracelets, known as manillas, to exchange for pepper, ivory and slaves. The artists of Benin transformed this European brass into plaques to decorate the oba's palace. When these plaques were first seen in Europe in the late 1890s they astounded art critics who couldn't believe that such technically accomplished sculptures were created by African artists.

	<b><a name="T3">78. Double-headed serpent </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Aztec turquoise mosaic of a double-headed serpent, probably worn on the chest for ceremonial occasions.

<br><br>

This serpent mosaic was created in Aztec Mexico. It may have been worn or carried during religious ceremonies. Snakes were sacred to the Aztecs as they were the symbol of the feathered serpent god, Quetzalcoatl. The Aztec Empire consisted of many subject territories, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Frequently they had to provide gifts as tribute to demonstrate their allegiance to the Aztec emperor. Tributes in the form of turquoise were particularly highly valued.
<br><br>
How was the Aztec Empire destroyed?
<br><br>
The arrival of the adventurer Hernando Cortez and his Spanish troops around 1519 brought an end to the Aztec Empire. The Spanish expedition was met by the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma who exchanged gifts, including possibly this turquoise serpent, with Cortez. In a surprise move Cortez imprisoned Moctezuma. After bitter fighting and a prolonged siege the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, fell to the Spanish in 1521. Much of the native population was wiped out by epidemics of smallpox and other contagious diseases brought by the Spanish.

	<b><a name="T4">79. Kakiemon elephants </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Porcelain elephants made in the Japanese Kakiemon style for the European market.

<br><br>

Elephants are not native to Japan and these two examples would have been based on depictions in imported prints. For centuries only the Chinese knew how to make porcelain but by the 1300s the knowledge had also spread to the Korean peninsula. When Japan's powerful ruler, the Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi, launched two attacks on Korea in the 1590s, his armies brought many Korean captives back to Japan. They shared their skills with local potters and helped to build a new porcelain industry in Japan.
<br><br>
How did these elephants arrive in Europe?
<br><br>
After the collapse of the Chinese Ming dynasty in 1644, Japan briefly became the world's largest global exporter of porcelain. Kakiemon-style porcelain, with its distinctive red enamel, was in great demand in Europe. These elephants would have been specifically made for the European market and transported from Japan by the Dutch East India Company - the world's first multinational company. After Japan tightened control of its borders in the late 1630s, the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to maintain direct contact through the port of Nagasaki.

	<b><a name="T5">80. Pieces of eight </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The most common silver coin of late sixteenth and seventeenth century Spain became the world’s first global currency.


<br><br>
Pieces of eight were the world's first global currency. As the coins of Spain they were used across the vast Spanish Empire, stretching from South America to the Philippines, but were also used outside the empire as well. In 1600 one coin would have been worth the equivalent of a modern pounds50 note. The front of the coin is decorated with the coat of arms of the Habsburgs, the rulers of Spain and the most powerful family in Europe.
<br><br>
Where did the silver for pieces of eight come from?
<br><br>
The inscription on this coin - King of the Spains and the Indies - refers to European Spain and the great new Spanish Empire in the Americas. The silver used to create the coins and finance Spain's armies and armadas came, above all, from the 'silver mountain' of Potosi in Bolivia. This wealth came at a terrible cost to human life. Thousands of indigenous American Indians and African slaves died in the brutal conditions of the mines to support Spain's thirst for silver.

	<b><a name="T6">81. Shi’a religious parade standard </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Iranian standard carried in Shi'a Islam processions, commemorating the death of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson.

<br><br>

Standards like this were used in religious processions in Iran 400 years ago. It was during this period that Iran changed from being a Sunni Islamic state to a Shi'a Islamic state. This standard is in the shape of the sword of Imam Ali - the husband of Fatima, daughter of the Prophet Mohammad. Shi'a Muslims believe that Imam Ali is the true successor to the Prophet. This sword is inscribed with the names of the Prophet, his family and the twelve Imams revered in Shi'ism.
<br><br>
Who were the Safavid dynasty?
<br><br>
The Safavid shahs ruled Iran from 1501 to 1722. They claimed to be the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. Under their rule Iran became the world's largest Shi'a state and Shi'ism developed many of the forms and practices still dominant today. Standards like this were originally used in battle to indicate the presence of the ruler but were adopted for use in religious processions during the Safavid period.

	<b><a name="T7">82. Miniature of a Mughal prince</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Miniature painting showing an encounter between an Indian Mughal prince and a holy man.

<br><br>

This miniature painting depicts an Indian Mughal prince and his attendants meeting an aged Muslim holy man in a garden. A scantily-clad worshipper kneels in front of the holy man. His lack of clothes indicates that he has rejected the trappings of everyday life. The miniature was probably painted under the reign of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, who was known to have often visited both Hindu and Muslim holy men as he travelled around his empire.
<br><br>
Who were the Mughals?
<br><br>
The Mughals were a Sunni Islamic dynasty that ruled Northern and Central India from 1526 to 1858. The early Mughal emperors successfully ruled the largely non-Muslim population of their empire by encouraging a culture of religious tolerance. Jahangir and his father Akbar promoted Hindus and Shi'ite Muslims to prominent roles in government and allowed people to worship freely. The art of miniature painting, which combined elements from Iran, Central Asia and India, was practiced by both Hindus and Muslims alike and encapsulates this multicultural society.

	<b><a name="T8">83. Shadow puppet of Bima</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Puppet of Bima, one of the heroes of the Indian epic the Mahabharata, used in shadow theatre performances in Indonesia.
<br><br>


This shadow puppet is at least 200 years old and is one of the oldest surviving shadow puppets in the world. It represents Bima the hero of the great Hindu epic The Mahabharata. Puppets like this are still used in the shadow theatres of Java. Plays are performed through the night by a single puppeteer. The central theme of a shadow theatre is the battle between good and evil and it was believed that during the performance the audience were protected from all evil things.
<br><br>
Why was a Hindu epic performed by Muslims in Java?
<br><br>
Islam spread to South East Asia in the 1500s through maritime trade routes, and often through the conversion of Buddhist and Hindu rulers. Islam adapted, rather than suppressed, elements of Hinduism, Buddhism and ancient Indonesian traditions like the shadow theatre. In Java, for example, it is believed that the faces of shadow puppets were distorted to avoid the Islamic laws forbidding the creation of images of humans and gods. In contrast the shadow puppets of the Island of Bali, which remained Hindu, retain realistic human features.

	<b><a name="T9">84. Mexican codex map</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Map of two Mexican towns, showing the impact of the Spanish conquest and survival of Mexican native society.

<br><br>

This Mexican map was made 50 years after the Spanish conquered the Aztecs in AD 1521. It is a property plan illustrating the foundation of two towns in the region of Tlaxcala, Mexico. Each town is represented by its newly built church - Santa Barbara Tamasolco (left) and Santa Ana (right). The script is written in an adapted form of the local language with an imported European alphabet. A list of the names of the main landowners on the map reveals that several Spanish settlers have intermarried with native aristocrats.
<br><br>
How did the Spanish convert native Mexicans to Christianity?
<br><br>
The Spanish justified their conquest of Mexico by arguing that it was their duty to convert the native population to Christianity. The people of Tlaxcala were not conquered but fought with the Spanish against the Aztecs. They were also supposedly the frst Mexican Indians to be baptised and become Christians. To attract converts missionaries often combined existing Mexican and Christian rituals. Aztec ancestor worship was merged with All Saints Day to create the Day of the Dead, still celebrated in Mexico today

<a href= "pic17.html">85. Reformation centenary broadsheet</a><br><br>


A German Broadsheet issued to mark the 100 year anniversary of the Protestant Reformation of the Christian Church.
<br><br>


This broadsheet commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation of the Christian Church. It depicts Martin Luther nailing his thesis to the door of Wittenberg Cathedral in 1517. Protestants regarded this moment as the start of the Reformation, when the new Protestant Church, opposed to the power of the pope, split from the Roman Catholic Church. Luther is shown writing on the door with a huge feather pen that knocks off the pope's hat. The lion is a reference to the pope's name - Leo X.
<br><br>
What is a broadsheet?
<br><br>
Broadsheets were sheets of paper used to spread news and political messages. They played an important role in the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter Reformation. Depictions of Luther at Wittenberg helped to popularise this event in the Protestant imagination. In reality, Luther probably didn't actually physically nail his thesis to the Cathedral door. This broadsheet was made in 1617 on the eve of the Thirty Years War between the Catholic and Protestant countries of Europe. During this unstable period this broadsheet would have reminded Protestants of past victories.

	<hr><br>
	
West African drum found in Virginia, USA in the 1700s probably brought from Africa on a slave trading voyage.
<br><br>


This drum is one of the oldest surviving African-American objects. The drum was collected in the early 1700s in the Colony of Virginia, now part of the United States of America. The drum, however, was made in the Akan region in Ghana, West Africa, where it would have been played during religious ceremonies and on social occasions. The drum probably travelled across the Atlantic on a slave ship, where it may have been used to exercise the enslaved Africans in an attempt to keep them healthy.
<br><br>
What is the musical legacy of drumming in plantations?
<br><br>
It is estimated that over 12 million Africans were transported to the Americas between 1501 and the abolition of the slave trade in the 1800s. They were brought to provide labour for mines and for plantations of sugar and rice, and later tobacco and cotton. Drumming and other African musical traditions continued in the colonies and gave rise to many different kinds of music including shouts, hollars, work songs, fife and drum and spirituals.

	<b><a name="T12">87. Hawaiian feather helmet</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
A feather helmet that probably belonged to a Hawaii Chief that was brought to Britain by Captain Cook.

<br><br>

This feather helmet would have been worn by a Hawaiian chief during a ceremony or in battle. It is made from wicker basketry and covered with the red feathers of honeycreepers and the yellow feathers of honeyeaters. Red and yellow were the Hawaiians' most important colours and were regarded as tapu - holding a sacred quality. Feathers enhanced mana - a spiritual force that can fill individuals or objects with power. Birds were regarded in Polynesia as spiritual messengers.
<br><br>
How did Captain Cook change Hawaiian society?
<br><br>
This helmet was probably collected in 1778 by Captain Cook or a crew member of his ship. They were the first Europeans to ever visit Hawaii. The Hawaiian Islands were first settled in around AD 400 but had probably been isolated from the rest of Polynesia for 500 years when Cook arrived. The arrival of Europeans proved to be highly influential. Kamehameha I modelled himself on European monarchs and was able to conquer and unite all the islands independent until the American takeover in 1893.

	<b><a name="T13">88. North American buckskin map</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Map made of deer skin showing the Ohio River, USA drawn by Native Americans and traded with Europeans.

<br><br>

This buckskin map depicts a vast area of the American Midwest between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. It was probably drawn by Piankshaw Indians and the red circles and semi-circles represent Native American settlement Native American maps are conceptual different than those of European settlers, containing more symbolic elements and reflecting different notions of space and time. Rivers were vitally important to Native Americans and the Wabash River runs along the spine of the deerskin, following the animal's life force.
<br><br>
Why was the map created?
<br><br>
Written phrases, like 'Piankashaw sold', on the lower right hand side of the map, suggest it was used as an intermediary tool to communicate between Europeans and Native Americans. It was probably created to aid negotiations during an attempt by the Wabash Land Company to purchase territory from the Piankashaw Indians in 1774 - 5. As European trappers and traders expanded west, private companies sought to purchase land from Native American nations. Such negotiations ignored the existing treaties with Native American people and this sale of land was declared void by the British colonial government.

	<b><a name="T14">89. Australian bark shield</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Shield made of bark from Botany Bay, Australia collected in 1770 on Captain Cook’s First Voyage.

<br><br>

This bark shield was carried by one of two Indigenous Australian men who faced Captain Cook and his crew members when they first landed at Botany Bay, near Sydney on the 29 April 1770. After attempts to communicate with the men failed, Cook's crew fired warning shots. This shield was dropped when the Indigenous Australians fed. The hole in the centre of the shield was probably made by a wooden spear and there are also traces of white clay decoration on the surface.
<br><br>
What was the significance of Cook's landing at Botany Bay?
<br><br>
Cook was not the first European to visit Australia or meet Indigenous Australians. Cook's encounter is seen by many as the beginning of European Australia. Cook went on to claim Australia for the British Empire in August 1770. The first European settlers, prison convicts, arrived at Botany Bay in 1788. This began the European colonisation of Australia, which led to an estimated 90 per cent reduction in the Indigenous Australian population.

	<hr><br>
	
Ancient Jade Bi around 3,000 years-old inscribed with characters by its later owner, the Chinese Qianlong Emperor.


<br><br>
This jade disc, known as a bi, was made in around 1200 BC but is inscribed with a text written in AD 1790. Similar discs have been found in the tombs of ancient Chinese aristocrats but their original function remains unclear. This bi was owned by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty (ruled AD 1736 - 95), who had the bi inscribed with a text he had written, commenting on the possible function of the piece and its antiquity. The Qianlong Emperor was renowned for his compositions and wrote around 40,000 texts.
<br><br>
Who were the Qing dynasty?
<br><br>
The Qing dynasty emperors were not native Han Chinese but were Manchus from beyond the northern Chinese border. As the ruler of a vast empire, it was imperative that the Qianlong Emperor demonstrated his understanding of China's history and culture. China's population more than doubled in the 1700s and the economy also boomed. Qing China was regarded by many intellectuals of the European Enlightenment as the greatest empire the world had ever seen.

91. Ship’s chronometer from HMS Beagle 
Ship’s clock designed to keep time at sea and used on HMS Beagle as it took Charles Darwin around the world.
<br><br>


A chronometer is a type of very accurate clock used to measure the time at sea so that a ship can precisely know where it is sailing. This chronometer was used on board HMS Beagle on its voyage around the world in 1831 to 1836. Charles Darwin was the scientist on this voyage, and the observations he made about geology and wildlife had an important influence on the development of his revolutionary ideas about evolution.
<br><br>
How did the need to measure longitude at sea lead to the standardisation of time?
<br><br>
The frst chronometers that could accurately keep time on board a ship were developed in the 1700s. The time on this chronometer would have been set at the time of the Greenwich Observatory in London. Knowing the time of a fixed location allowed the ship's navigator to know the difference between the ship's position and the Greenwich Meridian to determine the ship's longitude. In the 1840s the Great Western Railway used Greenwich Meantime as its standard measure of time. It replaced local time, which could vary by up to 20 minutes between towns.

	<hr><br>
	
Early Victorian teaset with a milk jug, sugar bowl and teapot produced by Wedgwood.
<br><br>


This tea set was made by the famous Staffordshire pottery frm founded by Josiah Wedgwood. It is made of red stoneware, which came to Europe from China via Holland in the 1600s, and can withstand hot water. Tea was initially a luxury product but by 1830 it was increasingly drunk by everyone in Britain using mass-produced pottery and porcelain. Historically this set has been associated with Queen Adelaide (1792 - 1849), wife of William IV. Although simple and originally moderately-priced, the pieces have been ornamented with silver to make them more prestigious and desirable.
<br><br>
How did drinking tea become a patriotic duty in Britain?
<br><br>
Vast geopolitical forces lie behind the creation of this simple tea set. In Britain between 1840 and 1900 the consumption of tea and sugar quadrupled. Mass consumption required mass production on an industrial scale and huge tea plantations were developed by the British in India and Sri Lanka. New sources of sugar were also developed, reducing the role of the former slave plantations in the Caribbean. Tea drinking was regarded as patriotic as it supported British trade and empire, unlike wine and coffee, beverages of imperial rivals.

	<hr><br>
	
‘Under the Wave, off Kanagawa’, a print by Katsushika Hokusai, perhaps the most reproduced of all Japanese prints.

<br><br>

'Under the Wave off Kanagawa' ('The Great Wave') is probably the most iconic Japanese artwork in the world. It depicts a monstrous wave about to come crashing down on three fishing boats and their crews. On the horizon is Mount Fuji, dwarfed by the colossal wave. The print was created by Hokusai when he was about seventy years old, as part of his Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji series. The print was made using colour woodblock printing and many thousands of impressions were made - each one sold quite cheaply.

How did The Great Wave become one of the most famous images in the world?
<br><br>
When The Great Wave was first issued, in about 1830, Japan's contact with the outside world was strictly regulated. It was only in 1859 when Japan, under pressure from America and other powers, opened a few of its ports that Japanese prints began to be exported to Europe. They were quickly discovered and celebrated by European and American artists like Whistler, Van Gogh and Monet. The Great Wave inspired Debussy's symphonic sketches La Mer and has become one of the most iconic images of the power of the sea.

	<b><a name="T19">94. Sudanese slit drum</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Wooden drum from central Africa, inscribed with Islamic markings in Sudan and brought to Britain in 1898.

<br><br>

This buffalo-shaped drum probably came to Khartoum through the internal African slave trade from non-Muslim southern Sudan. There it would have been played as part of a court orchestra and used to transmit messages or summon warriors to war. It was captured by the British and Egyptian army in a battle against Mahdist forces at Omdurman near Khartoum in 1898, after which a crown designating it as the property of Queen Victoria was stamped into the animal's tail.
<br><br>
Who was the Mahdi?
<br><br>
In 1881 a Sudanese sheik called Muhammad Ahmad declared that he was the Mahdi - the prophesied redeemer of Islam who would found a new Islamic World Order. After a lengthy military campaign he and his followers took control of Sudan from the previous Turkish-Egyptian government. The Mahdi united many of Sudan's diverse ethnic groups, while conquering and enslaving others. Many non-Muslim slaves from southern lands were nominally converted to Islam and served in the Mahdist army. Some of their artefacts, like this slit drum, were assimilated into Mahdist ideology and inscribed with Islamic decoration.

<a href= "pic19.html">95. Suffragette-defaced penny </a><br><br>


Penny minted in 1903, and illegally stamped by suffragettes with the slogan ‘votes for women’.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC
<br><br>
This penny, struck in 1903, has been defaced with the slogan 'Votes for Women' over the portrait of King Edward VII. At the start of Edward VII's reign women, along with the poor and criminals, were denied the right to vote. Mutilating coins was one of the methods suffragettes used to spread their message of universal suffrage to a wide audience. Pennies were used by all sections of society and were so small a denomination they were rarely recalled by the Bank.
<br><br>
How else did the Suffragettes campaign for votes for women?
<br><br>
Suffragette derives from the word suffrage meaning the right to vote. As well as conventional campaigning, the suffragettes also attacked museums, famously slashing The Rokeby Venus, a painting in the National Gallery, in 1914. They also smashed a mummy case in the British Museum. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act gave women over the age of 30 the right to vote but it was not until 1928 that women were given the same voting rights as men.

	<b><a name="T21">96. Russian revolutionary plate</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Russian plate decorated with images and marxist slogans to celebrate the Russian Revolution.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic20.html">96. Russian revolutionary plate</a><br><br>

This plate depicts a worker trampling the word 'Kapital' (capitalism), to release the dynamic forces of a new industrial order for the benefit of the workers. The plate was created to celebrate the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the creation of the world's first Communist state. The whole image is in the Futurist style favoured by the artists of the Revolution. It was designed by Mikhail Mikhailovich Adamovich (1884 - 1947) and created in the State Porcelain Factory in Petrograd, previously named St Petersburg.
<br><br>
How was porcelain used to spread propaganda about the Russian Revolution?
<br><br>
The former Imperial Porcelain Factory, founded in 1744, worked exclusively for the Russian Royal Family and Imperial Court. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the factory was renamed the State Porcelain Factory. Existing stocks of plates produced before the Revolution, but not yet decorated, were painted with the symbols and slogans of the new Soviet republic. This plate was made in 1901 under Tsar Nicholas II, but decorated in 1921. Many such plates were exported abroad, demonstrating how luxury objects from the Tsar's own factory could symbolize the overthrow of the capitalist system.

	<b><a name="T22">97. Hockney’s In the Dull Village</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Print by British artist David Hockney showing two men lying in bed, an illustration for a poem by poet C.P. Cavafy.
<br><br>


This etching is from a series created in 1966 by David Hockney to illustrate 14 poems by the Greek poet C. P. Cavafy (1863 - 1933). Cavafy was one of the earliest modern authors to write about same-sex love and proved an inspiration to the young Hockney, who stole a copy of Cavafy's translated poems from Bradford Library in 1960. The etching is not a literal interpretation of the poem's subject matter - homo-erotic fantasies in a sleepy, provincial village - but instead evokes the poem's mood of relaxed intimacy through the use of a crisp and spare line.
<br><br>
How did the Hellenic world inspire Hockney?
<br><br>
Cavafy was born in the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria in Egypt and his poems frequently express same-sex love in the Hellenic world. When Hockney created this print Britain was in the grip of its own sexual revolution - homosexuality was decriminalised by Parliament in 1967. Hockney visited Beirut in Lebanon, which had replaced Alexandria as the region's cosmopolitan capital, to draw inspiration for his series. Many of the illustrations were actually drawn in Hockney's Notting Hill flat, however, using two friends as models.

	<b><a name="T23">98. Throne of Weapons</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Throne made by an artist from Mozambique from European weapons used in and collected after the civil war.

<br><br>

This sculpture is made out of decommissioned weapons from the Mozambique civil war (1977 - 92), which claimed almost 1 million lives and left 5 million people displaced. It represents both the tragedy of that war and the human triumph of those who achieved a lasting peace. It was made by the Mozambican artist Cristovao Canhavato (Kester) in 2001 for the Transforming Arms into Tools project, where some of the seven million guns left in the country are voluntarily exchanged for useful tools and hardware.

<br><br>

What caused the Mozambique civil war?
<br><br>
In 1975 Mozambique declared itself a Marxist-Leninist state after achieving independence from Portuguese colonial rule. The new government's pro-communist and anti-apartheid stance threatened the regimes in neighbouring. South Africa and Rhodesia. They funded an opposition group in an attempt to destabilize the country. In turn the Soviet Union supplied Mozambique with economic and military aid. The civil war finally came to an end after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the apartheid regimes.

	<b><a name="T24">99. Credit card </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Credit card, the first form of electronic payment, issued in the United Arab Emirates and Shari’a law compliant.
<br><br>


This credit card exemplifies the global nature of modern finance. HSBC, originally founded in Hong Kong and Shanghai, created its Amanah division in 1998 to appeal to the growing financial hubs in the Middle East and Asia. Islamic law forbids exchanging money for profit and this card is Shari'a compliant, meaning that interest cannot be received on savings, or charged on borrowings. Shari'a compliant banks also cannot invest money in socially or morally damaging businesses and are mindful that Muslims must use their wealth to help the less fortunate.
<br><br>
When was the first plastic credit card created?
<br><br>
In the 20th century financial transactions in many western countries were increasingly no longer made in cash but through credit facilities, cheques and electronic money. The first credit card was the Diners Club Card, created by businessman Frank McNamara in 1950, after an occasion when he did not have enough cash to pay for dinner. Today, over fifty percent of all transactions in the USA and UK are made on plastic cards, although in the rest of the world cash is still used for the majority of purchases.

	<hr><br>
	
A solar-powered lamp and charger for mobile phones that can provide renewable energy to the developing world.

<br><br>

This lamp is powered by the small solar panel connected to it. As well as providing light, power from this panel can be used to charge mobile phones. This object has been chosen to reflect our ingenuity, and the challenges we face, in the twenty-first century. The kit uses a range of new materials and technologies, including silicon-chip technology, which can also be found in computers and mobile phones. Here it is used in the solar photovoltaic cell, which converts sunlight into electricity. Exposing this cell to eight hours of bright sunshine provides up to 100 hours of lamp light.
<br><br>
How is this technology changing lives?
<br><br>
There are currently 1.6 billion people across the world without access to an electrical grid. In these areas, objects such as this allow people to study, work and socialise outside daylight hours, vastly improving the quality of many lives. Additionally, households using solar energy rather than kerosene lamps are able to avoid the risk of fire and the damage to health that kerosene can cause. Once purchased, this kit costs very little to run, making it a very efficient option for many people living in the world's poorest countries.

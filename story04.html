Maya temple carving of Lady Kab’al Xook piercing her tongue to induce pain and provoke a visionary trance.
<br><br>

This lintel from the doorway of a Maya temple depicts a royal blood-letting ceremony. King Shield Jaguar III stands facing his wife, Lady Xook, as she pulls a rope embedded with thorns through her tongue. She is undertaking this painful ordeal in order to contact Shield Jaguar's ancestors in the spirit realm. In Maya society, a ruler's power was based on the knowledge gained by communicating with the supernatural world through blood-letting rituals.
<br><br>
Who were the Maya?
<br><br>
The Maya ruled much of Mexico and Central America between AD 250 and 100. Around 60 separate Maya citystates developed - some were bitter enemies, others forged alliances. Bloodletting and human sacrifice was used to mark significant events in the lives of Maya rulers, such as the birth of an heir, accession to the throne and death. The Maya used different calendars to calculate the exact time for these ceremonies, including a sophisticated 52-year cycle, which was part of a larger calculation of time known as the Long Count.

	<b><a name="T2">52. Harem wall painting fragments</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Fragments of a wall-painting of women from the caliph’s palace in Samara, one of the Islamic Empire's great cities.

<br><br>
The two figures, displayed on these wall painting fragments, are probably slave girls from the harem of Caliph al-Muasim in Samarra. Although simply drawn, they have a distinct personality and conjure up images of the Arabian Nights stories, some of which were set in Samarra. The women of the palace were not just wives and concubines but were also poets and musicians. Harem girls were often highly trained in singing, music and literature and it was potentially an attractive career for a woman of humble origins.
<br><br>
What happened to Samarra?
<br><br>
Samarra was built as the new capital of the Islamic Empire in AD 836 and, at the time, was one of the largest cities in the world. Samarra was created to house the Caliph's court and army of Turkish slavesoldiers, after they increasingly came into conflict with the inhabitants of Baghdad. In AD 861, after the Turkish commanders assassinated the Caliph al-Mutawakkil, Samarra was abandoned. Samarra's decline mirrors that of the Islamic Empire, which became increasingly fragmented from AD 800 onwards.

	<b><a name="T3">53. Lothair Crystal </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Crystal engraved with images from the Biblical story of Susanna, made for the Medieval King Lothair.
<br><br>


This crystal was made for Lothair II, king of the Franks. It depicts the biblical story of Susanna and the elders, in which Susanna is accused of adultery before being proved innocent by the Prophet Daniel. The subject matter may reflect Lothair's own marital problems. He attempted to divorce his wife, accusing her of incest. After the pope refused the divorce, Lothair forgave his wife and this crystal may have been made to reflect his acceptance of his wife's innocence.
<br><br>
Why did Lothair really want a divorce?
<br><br>
Lothair's great grandfather Charlemagne created the largest state in Europe since the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's sons divided this empire into France, Germany and Lothair's middle kingdom C Lorraine. Lothair was desperate for a divorce because his wife could not provide him with an heir. This failure to produce a son led to Lothair's kingdom being divided between his uncles. If he had produced an heir Lorraine might now rank with France and Germany, as one of the great states of Europe.

	<b><a name="T4">54. Statue of Tara </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The female Buddhist deity Tara from Sri Lanka represents mercy and compassion and is a focus for meditation.

<br><br>

This statue of the Buddhist goddess Tara combines the spiritual and the sensual. The sculpture would have been used as a focus for meditation on the qualities Tara represents, mercy and compassion. Originally the sculpture would have been placed in a temple alongside a statue of her male companion, the bodhisattva, Avalokiteshevara. Bodhisattvas are beings who have reached enlightenment but have turned back from it, out of compassion so that they can still help mankind escape from the cycle of death, rebirth and suffering.
<br><br>
Who commisioned this statue?
<br><br>
When this sculpture was made, Sri Lanka had been predominantly Buddhist for about 1,000 years. It was then a hub for Indian Ocean trade and the sculpture may have been made by one of the Sri Lankan kings. Tara appears as a goddess in both Hinduism and Buddhism, as both religions share a common Indian cultural background. The earliest Buddhist deities were conceived as male and Mahayana Buddhism may have incorporated female deities, like Tara, to attract more female worshipers.

	<b><a name="T5">55. Chinese Tang tomb figures </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Ceramic figures from the burial of a Chinese Tang general, made to entertain, serve and protect him in the afterlife.

<br><br>

These 12 figures were buried in the tomb of the Tang general Liu Tingxun. He died in AD 728 at the advanced age of 72. The figurines are among the tallest known to have survived from this era. Then Chinese people believed that you needed to furnish your tomb with all the things which were essential to your status in life. The human and animal figures were created to serve and protect Liu Tingxun in the afterlife. The supernatural guardian figures warded off evil spirits.
<br><br>
Who were the Tang?
<br><br>
The Tang dynasty (AD 618-906) represents a golden age of achievement in Chinese history. Under Tang rule, China became the richest and most powerful political unit in the world. China's success lay in its control of the oasis towns along the Silk Route, sending silk westwards and receiving luxury goods and animals such as horses. Camels were used as beasts of burden because of their ability to travel long distances on small rations of water.

	<b><a name="T6">56. Vale of York Hoard</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Hoard of Viking silver probably gathered from across Europe, discovered in 2007 buried in North Yorkshire.
<br><br>


This Viking hoard was discovered in 2007 in North Yorkshire. It was buried in AD 927 and contains 617 silver coins, which were tightly packed into a Frankish silver cup, along with silver bars, and both intact and broken jewellery. This treasure was probably accumulated through a combination of raiding and trading throughout Europe and beyond. Some of the jewellery is Scandinavian, some Russian and some of the coins are from Central Asia. The Vikings originally came from Scandinavia but settled in Scotland, Ireland, Normandy and northern and eastern England.
<br><br>
Why was the hoard buried?
<br><br>
Around AD 920 Britain was divided into a southern Anglo-Saxon kingdom and the Viking kingdom of Northumbria, with its capital in York. The hoard probably belonged to a member of York's powerful Viking elite. The dates of the later coins show that the hoard was buried after the Anglo Saxon king, Athelstan, conquered Northumbria in AD 927. Uniting the two kingdoms, Athelstan was the first king who could claim to rule over the whole of what would become England.

	<hr><br>
	
Glass beaker from central Europe probably made by a Muslim craftsman in Syria or Egypt during the Crusades.

<br><br>

This beaker is decorated with Christian symbols, including a lion, a griffin, an eagle and a tree. Yet scientific analysis and the deep-cut style of the glass suggest it was made by a Muslim craftsman in Syria during the Crusades. Fourteen Hedwig beakers have been found, all in Europe, indicating that these objects were made specifically for a Christian market. Hedwig beakers take their name from Saint Hedwig (about AD 1174 C 1243), who supposedly drank water from a similar glass, which miraculously turned to wine when it touched her lips.
<br><br>
How did Islamic glass reach Christian Europe during the Crusades?
<br><br>
In 1095 Pope Urban II called on all Christians to recapture Jerusalem and the surrounding Holy Land from Islamic control. In return, the pope promised Crusaders forgiveness for past sins. Nine Crusades were launched over the next 200 years, with increasingly diminishing degrees of success. Despite the Crusades, trade between the Christian and the Islamic countries flourished. Islamic glassware was particularly in demand and the Italian ports of Venice and Genoa grew rich as a result of trade with the Islamic world.

Bronze mirror decorated with dancing cranes found in a pool at a Japanese shrine where it was thrown as an offering.

<br><br>

This bronze mirror was found in the 'mirror-pool' at the shrine on Mount Haguro, where it was thrown, along with hundreds of other mirrors, as an offering. The back is decorated with two dancing cranes - symbols of long life and marital fidelity in Japan. The other side is undecorated and was polished to create a reflective surface. Mirrors were first imported from China in AD 300. They were associated with the sun-goddess Amaterasu, ancestress of the Japanese emperors, because of their ability to reflect light.
<br><br>
What was Japan like when the mirror was made?
<br><br>
For many centuries Japan was influenced by China. Then, in AD 894, the Heian emperor took the momentous decision to cease contact with China. For the next three centuries Japanese culture developed in isolation. The Heian court during this period became renowned for its style and aestheticism. Courtiers communicated by writing poetry and held incense fragrance contests. It was during this period that the Tale of Genji was written, arguably the world's first novel.

Head of a Buddha statue from Borobudur in Java, one of the largest Buddhist monuments in the world.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic11.html">59. Borobudur Buddha head</a><br><br>


This head of the Buddha originally comes from a statue in Borobudur in Java. Borobudur is one of the largest Buddhist monuments in the world, containing around 500 statues of the Buddha. The monument was built between AD 780 and 840 to resemble a mandala - a wheel-shaped symbol of the cosmos. Walking up the monument replicates the path to enlightenment, beginning at the base in the realm of desire and ending with the realm of formlessness at the top.
<br><br>
How did Buddhism spread to Java?
<br><br>
The style of the Buddha's head is similar to sculptures made in India and Sri Lanka. Both Buddhist and Hindu monuments were built in Java at the time of Borobudur and the Indian language of Sanskrit was used on inscriptions. Buddhism and Hinduism came to Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia from India. There were long established trading contacts between South East Asia and India, reaching back before AD 1, with merchants trading spices and other goods by sea. This trade also linked Java with China.

	<hr><br>
	
Broken pieces of pottery from China, the Middle East and Africa found at a port in Tanzania on Africa’s east coast.

<br><br>

These broken pieces of pots were found on the shores of Kilwa Kiswani, an island off Tanzania, which was once home to a major medieval African port. The pale green porcelain pieces are from China, the dark green and blue pieces come from the Persian Gulf and the brown unglazed pieces were made in East Africa. This rubbish reveals a complex trade network that spread across the Indian Ocean, centuries before the European maritime empires of Spain, Portugal and Britain.
<br><br>
Who brought these pots to Kilwa?
<br><br>
From around AD 800 merchants from Africa, the Middle East, India, and later even China flocked to the East African ports of Kilwa and Mombasa, which quickly grew into wealthy cities. These merchants traded in pots, spices, ivory, gems, wood, metal and slaves. A new language, Swahili, developed in this multi-cultural environment, combining existing African languages with Arabic. Islam was adopted as the religion in these ports, perhaps to aid in trade relations with the Middle East and also to protect African merchants from being enslaved by other Muslims.

Chessmen found in Scotland, for playing a game from India and brought to Christian Europe via the Islamic world.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC
<br><br>
These chess pieces were found unexpectedly on a beach on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1831. They were carved from walrus ivory and whale tooth between around 1150 and 1200. When found some were stained red, suggesting that the original colour combination of the pieces was red and white. The chess pieces were probably made in Norway. At this time the Isle of Lewis was part of the kingdom of Norway. The chess pieces may have been buried by a merchant travelling along the trade route from Scandinavia to Ireland.
<br><br>
Where did chess originate?
<br><br>
Chess originated in India after 500 BC and had arrived in Christian Europe via the Islamic world by at least the AD 990s. The original Indian and Islamic game was adapted to reflect medieval European society, so that the Indian war elephant was replaced with the figure of the bishop. The rooks biting their shields resemble the Viking berserkers of Norse myth, while the pose of the queens is derived from depictions of the grieving Virgin Mary. The pawns, lacking any human features, reflect the abstract pieces used in the Islamic version of the game.

<a href= "pic12.html">62. Hebrew astrolabe </a><br><br>


Instrument for working out the time of day using the sun or stars, probably made for a Jewish scholar in Islamic Spain.


<br><br>
An astrolabe is a scientific instrument used to work out the time of day using the sun or the stars. It could also be used for astrological horoscopes and mathematical calculations. Astrolabes were first made around 150 BC in Greece. They were further developed by Islamic scholars and were often used for determining the exact direction of Mecca. The astrolabe finally came into Western Europe via Spain, which was conquered by Islamic forces in AD 711.
<br><br>
Who was this astrolabe made for?
<br><br>
This astrolabe is inscribed with words in hebrew and Arabic, indicating it was probably made for a Jewish scholar in Spain. Christian forces had reconquered the majority of Spain from the Islamic Caliphate by AD 1238. Spain, however, retained a mixed population of Christians, Jews and Muslims that coexisted in relative harmony. Muslim and Jewish scholars even worked together, translating the works of Aristotle and other Greek authors into Latin. These works had been preserved in Arabic translations but had been largely forgotten in medieval Europe.

Head of an Oni, one of the rulers of Ife in Nigeria, one of medieval Africa’s most powerful and wealthy kingdoms.
<br><br>


This head probably depicts an Ooni, a ruler of the West African kingdom of Ife that flourished between AD 1100 and 1500. The portrait-like realism of Ife heads is unique in African art. This naturalism astonished art historians when the first Ife heads were brought to Europe in 1911. One German explorer even proposed they were made by Greek settlers in Africa - the origins of Plato's Atlantis myth. Eighteen heads have been found in total, and their stylistic similarities suggest that they were made by an individual artist or in a single workshop.
<br><br>
What was life like in medieval Africa?
<br><br>
The kingdom of Ife first emerged around AD 800. It was one of several competing West African kingdoms that developed during the medieval period. Ife's power and wealth was probably partly derived from its access to the lucrative Niger River trade routes, connecting it to the wider trade networks of West Africa and the Sahara. Today Ife is regarded as the spiritual heartland of the Yoruba people of southwest Nigeria. Ife is celebrated as the place of origin of mankind, where the gods descended from heaven to populate the world.

Chinese blue-and-white porcelain vases, early examples of this popular style traded across the Middle East and Europe.

<br><br>

The David Vases are the best-known porcelain vases in the world because of the rare inscriptions around their necks, dating them to precisely AD 1351. When first discovered they were believed to be the oldest dated example of blue-and-white porcelain in the world. They are named after their most famous owner, Sir Percival David (1892-1964), who built-up one of the world's greatest Chinese ceramic collections. They were originally altar vases, commissioned by a man called Zhang Wenjin, and presented as an offering to a Daoist temple.
<br><br>
Who created the first blue-and-white porcelain?
<br><br>
The David Vases were made during the reign of the foreign Yuan dynasty (1279-1368), when China was at the heart of a vast Mongol Empire. Trade flourished between China and the Middle East and cobalt, used to create the blue effect, came from the other side of the empire in Iran. Archaeologists have unearthed materials which now show that Yuan dynasty blue-and-white porcelain was made for several different markets, rather than solely for export as was once thought. Different consumers demanded specific forms, sizes and designs.

Wooden seat carved in the shape of an ancestor spirit by the Taino, one of the pre-European, native Caribbean peoples.
<br><br>


This wooden seat known as a duho was sculpted by a Taino artisan. The Taino were one of the pre-European, native peoples of the Caribbean. It is carved in the shape of an ancestor spirit known as a cemi. Duhos were used to communicate with the spirit world. A Taino chief would sit in his duho and then snort psychedelic snuff made from the seeds of the cohoba tree. They would then ask the spirits for advice on the future, such as whether to go to war.
<br><br>
What was Taino society like?
<br><br>
Before the arrival of Europeans, the Caribbean was home to two main ethnic groups - the Taino and the Caribs. The Taino generally lived in the northern islands including Cuba, Jamaica and the Bahamas, while the Caribs lived in the southern islands. The Taino were farmers who lived in highly-organised societies, divided into nobles and commoners. They were ruled by both male and female chiefs. Only the chief or an important visitor could sit in a duho. Christopher Columbus was given this honour when he arrived in the Caribbean in 1492.

A container made to house and display a thorn said to be from Jesus Christ’s crown of thorns.

<br><br>

The Crown of Thorns, worn by Jesus when he was mocked and crucified, was one of the great relics of medieval Christianity. It was acquired by Louis IX, king of France, in Constantinople in AD 1239 for the price of 135,000 livres - nearly half the annual expenditure of France. Jean, duc de Berry (1340-1416) commissioned this elaborate reliquary to house just one of the thorns, which is mounted on a large sapphire in the centre.
<br><br>
How were relics used in medieval Europe?
<br><br>
Christian relics were usually part of the physical remains of a saint, though they could also be associated objects or clothing. Medieval worshippers would contemplate relics as a means of getting closer to a saint or Christ himself. Relics were also associated with miraculous powers of healing. Pilgrims would travel hundreds of miles to visit important relics in shrines, such as Jerusalem or Canterbury. Trade in holy relics was a huge business in Medieval Europe and kings would assemble large collections and even go to war to secure them.

Christian icon showing the Triumph of Orthodoxy, when religious art became accepted by the Byzantine church.
<br><br>

<a href= "pic13.html">67. Icon of the Triumph of Orthodoxy</a><br><br>

This icon commemorates the Triumph of Orthodoxy, a pivotal moment in Byzantine history. It depicts the Empress Theodora, dressed in red, who restored the use of images in religious worship in AD 843. For over a century previously, emperors had forbidden images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Saints. Empress Theodora is accompanied by her son and saints associated with the veneration of icons. This icon was made over 500 years after this event, when the shrunken Byzantine Empire was under the threat of invasion by the Ottoman Turks.
<br><br>
What role did icons play in the Byzantine Empire?
<br><br>
The Byzantine Empire was the eastern Greek-speaking half of the Roman Empire. While the last Roman emperor was deposed in AD 476, the Byzantine Empire continued until 1453. What we think of as the Eastern Orthodox Church was created largely within the Byzantine Empire, and the veneration of icons is part of its legacy. The painted icon on a flat wooden panel, that we are familiar with today, has its origins in the Byzantine Empire. Icons are still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church to focus worshippers' prayers on a particular saint or subject.

Indian temple statue of divine Hindu couple, Shiva and Parvati, showing male and female union and marital fidelity.


<br><br>
This statue of the divine Hindu couple, the great god Shiva and his wife Parvati, would have probably been placed above a door to a temple. Hindu worshippers used sculptures to develop a close relationship with the gods depicted. Gods would only inhabit a perfectly made statue and sculptors had to ritually purify themselves before they commenced carving. Such statues were primarily for beginners. Experienced worshippers were expected to commune with the gods through prayer and meditation without images.
<br><br>
What do Shiva and Parvati symbolise?
<br><br>
This statue comes from Orissa on the East coast of India. The arrival of Islam in North India in the 1200s caused the centre of Hinduism to shift to south and central India. Orissa was associated with the god Shiva and tantric Hinduism focussed on esoteric teaching and hidden rituals. Shiva represents contrasting values C both lust and purity, peace and destruction. When depicted together with his wife, Parvati, he represents the union of male and female and marital fidelity.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T19">69. Sculpture of Huastec goddess</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Sculpture of a goddess made by the Huastec people of Mexico, associated with the Aztec goddess of sexuality.
<br><br>


This statue was made by the Huastecs, a people conquered by the Aztecs in about 1450. Goddess statues like this were erected throughout Huastec territory and were the main focus of their religion. Making statues of the gods was thought to be dangerous. Sculptors feared they or their families might die as a result, so they fasted and performed prayers and rituals before they began. The Aztecs identified the Huastec mother-goddess with their own goddess of fertility and sexuality, Tlazolteotl, and the two figures in some ways merged.
<br><br>
What was the Aztec attitude to sin?
<br><br>
Tlazolteotl was the goddess of filth worshipped throughout Mesoamerica. She was a goddess of sexuality and fertility who would devour excrement and sin and transform it into renewed vitality. Sex was highly regulated in Aztec society and sexual transgressions heavily punished. Some sexual misdemeanours were confessed to a priest of Tlazolteotl and were forgiven if the penitent worshipper underwent an appropriate penance. Usually they would shed their own blood as part of this, piercing their tongue, ears or penis with a stingray spine.

	<hr><br>
	
Moai statue from the Island of Rapa Nui, (Easter Island), one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.

<br><br>

This statue known as a moai comes from the Island of Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island. Rapa Nui in the Pacific Ocean is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. Polynesians first settled on it before AD 800. Around 1000 moai were carved, probably to commemorate important former chiefs who were revered as divine. By 1600 the islanders ceased to make moai and they began to topple and even bury some of them.
<br><br>
Why did the Rapanui stop making moai?
<br><br>
Rapa Nui was deforested during the centuries people lived there and much of its birdlife became extinct. A birdman cult emerged that replaced the worship of moai. Birdman motifs can be seen on the back of this statue. The central ritual of this religion saw chiefs compete to capture the first sooty tern egg of the season. The triumphant chief would then become the birdman. Representing the creator god, he would live for one year in isolation, shaving his hair and growing his nails like talons.

<a href= "pic14.html">71. Tughra of Suleiman the Magnificent</a><br><br>


Imperial signature monogram of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent who ruled the Ottoman Turkish Empire from 1520 to 1566.

<br><br>

This document is a tughra, the official signature of the ruler of the Ottoman Empire - Suleiman the Magnifcent. This example would have been placed at the beginning of a state document to guarantee its authenticity. The origin of the tughra's looping shape is unknown but it may have been inspired by the silhouette of a falcon or a piece of horse hair. Sultans would choose their own personal tughra from a range of signatures drawn up by a court calligrapher on the day of their accession.
<br><br>
Who were the Ottomans?
<br><br>
Under the rule of Suleiman the Magnifcent (1520 - 1566) the Ottoman Empire reached its height. The inscription on this Tughra - 'the one who is always victorious' - is a fitting tribute to Suleiman's military prowess. Suleiman personally led his armies into battle and he captured Belgrade, Rhodes and large areas of Iran. He was also a keen patron of the arts and calligraphy flourished during his reign. The empire was never as strong after Suleiman's death but the Ottomans continued to dominate the Middle East and the Mediterranean until the 1800s.

Banknote worth 1000 bronze coins. China was one of the first countries to develop a tradition of printing money.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic15.html">72. Ming banknote</a><br><br>

This Chinese Ming dynasty banknote is inscribed with the title Great Ming circulating treasure note and a warning that counterfeiting is punishable by death. Paper currency was first used in China as early as AD 1000. However, the Ming were the first Chinese dynasty to try to totally replace coins with paper money. The state issued too much paper money, however, causing hyper-inflation. By 1425 paper money was worth only a seventieth of its original value and the use of paper currency in China was suspended.
<br><br>
Who were the Ming dynasty?
<br><br>
This banknote was commissioned by, Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming emperor. In 1368 he took part in the rebellion to overthrow the Mongol Yuan dynasty that ruled China. China enjoyed a long period of stability under the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644). Many of China's ancient traditions were restored but China also pursued an expansionist foreign policy. Expeditions were sent across the Indian Ocean to India, the Middle East and East Africa. The introduction of yams, maize and potatoes by the Spanish and Portuguese allowed Ming China's population to double to at least 100 million.

	<hr><br>
	
Small gold figurine created as a religious offering, possibly in a mountain top sacrifice - part of an Inca state ritual.
<br><br>

This small gold model of a llama is a fitting offering for an Inca mountain god. The Incas revered gold as the sweat of the sun and believed that it represented the sun's regenerative powers. All gold belonged to the ruler of the empire, the Inca himself, who claimed to be descended from the sun god. Llamas were the Incas' most important domestic animal, providing food, clothing and acting as beasts of burden. They were also often sacrificed in large numbers to the gods.
<br><br>
Who were the Incas?
<br><br>
The Inca Empire stretched over 5,500 kilometres and was the largest state in the world in the 1400s. Around 40,000 Inca nobles ruled an empire of 12 million conquered people throughout the Andes mountain range in South America. The Incas diverted rivers and used sophisticated irrigation systems to transform mountainsides into lush, terraced fields. Subject people were required to provide soldiers and labourers to work on farms and in mines. Spanish forces arrived in the Andes in the 1530s and finally conquered the Incas after a 40-year struggle.

	<hr><br>
	
Cup that belonged to Ulugh Beg, ruler of the central Asian Timurid Empire, and thought to be able to detect poison.


<br><br>
This jade cup from Central Asia would have been valued for its beauty and its protective powers. When this cup was made it was believed that jade would crack if it came into contact with poison. The cup's inscription indicates it was owned by Ulugh Beg, ruler of the Timurid Empire from 1447 to 1449. Ulugh Beg would have owned such a cup to protect himself from assassination by his rivals. However, the cup could not save him from his own son who seized power in 1449 and had Ulugh beheaded.
<br><br>
Who were the Timurids?
<br><br>
Ulugh Beg was the grandson of Timur, known in the west as Tamerlane, or 'Timur the Lame', due to a leg injury sustained in battle. Originally the ruler of a small Turkish tribe, Timur conquered the whole of Iran and Central Asia to create the Timurid Empire. After Timur's death in 1405, the empire began to disintegrate. Ulugh ruled the empire for only two years but despite the political instability it was a golden age for Iranian art. The dragon on this cup reflects Ulugh Beg's taste for Chinese decoration.

	<b><a name="T25">75. Dürer’s Rhinoceros</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Print by artist and pioneering print-maker Albrecht Dürer showing the arrival in Portugal of an Indian rhinoceros.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic16.html">75. Dürer’s Rhinoceros</a><br><br>

This print of a rhinoceros was created by Albrecht Dürer, the most famous artist of his day. Dürer's celebrity was in part due to his ability to make his work both available and affordable to a mass audience. The new technology of woodcut printing allowed drawings to be mass produced; around 4000 to 5000 copies of the rhino print were probably sold in Dürer's lifetime. Dürer, however, never actually saw a live rhino and based his drawing on a brief sketch and a letter.
<br><br>
Which rhino inspired Dürer's print?
<br><br>
The rhino that inspired Dürer's print was given by an Indian sultan to King Manuel of Portugal in 1515. At the time Portugal's navy dominated the Indian Ocean and controlled the world's spice trade. The rhino was the first to arrive in Europe since the days of the Roman Empire and caused a sensation. Seeking approval for his Eastern empire, the Portuguese king sent the rhino as a gift to the pope. However, the ship carrying the rhino sank in a storm and the unfortunate rhino was drowned.

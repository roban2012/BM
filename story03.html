	<b><a name="T1">26. Oxus chariot model</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Model of a Persian chariot buried in a hoard from Central Asia.

<br><br>

This gold chariot comes from a hoard found near the Oxus river in Central Asia. It depicts a driver and probably a satrap - a governor of the Persian Empire. Satraps kept the peace, regulated the law and collected taxes in one of the empire's administrative provinces. The Persians built many new roads to enable communication and developed the first postal service. Religions freely intermingled in the empire and an image of the Egyptian dwarf-god Bes can be seen on the front of this chariot.<br><br>

How was such a vast empire ruled?<br><br>

Cyrus the Great transformed Persia from a small kingdom to the world's first superpower. The Persian Empire was the first to span three continents. Cyrus was a tolerant leader to those who submitted to his rule. He and his successors allowed their subjects to speak their own languages, practise their own religion and follow their own way of life. Rulers throughout history would be influenced by this 200-year period of Persian rule known as the Pax Persica (Persian Peace).

	<b><a name="T2">27. Parthenon sculpture: Centaur and Lapith</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Sculpture of a half-man, half-horse rearing over a dead human from the Parthenon in Athens, Greece.
<br><br>


This sculpture from the Parthenon shows a Centaur rearing triumphantly over a dying human Lapith. This focus on human suffering epitomises the intense humanism of Greek art. The sculpture also represents Greece's struggle to resist being absorbed into the Persian Empire. The Greeks had a strong notion of their own identity and regarded the Persians as barbarians like the Centaurs. The Parthenon was completed in 432 BC on the site of an earlier unfinished temple destroyed by the Persians.<br><br>

What was the legacy of Classical Greece?
<br><br>
Victory over the Persians in 479 BC inspired a period of great creativity in Athens. This was the time of the philosopher Socrates, the playwright Sophocles and the statesmen Pericles. The wealth from Athens' Mediterranean empire funded the building of the Parthenon - an architectural testament to Athenian supremacy. Although Athens' golden age lasted for less than a century it was hugely influential. Greek ideas in drama, philosophy, literature, art, science and maths would dominate European thought for the next two millennia.

	<hr><br>
	
Two flagons used for pouring mead, wine or beer at feasts and probably found in the burial of an unknown man.
<br><br>


These two flagons are exquisite examples of early Celtic art. They probably came from a burial of an important person and would have been used to pour wine, beer or mead at feasts. The flagons were expensive luxuries and they contain pieces of red coral - now faded to white - traded from the Mediterranean. When wine was poured it would flow under the duck just behind the spout, giving the duck the appearance that it was swimming.
<br><br>
Who were the Celts?
<br><br>
The Celts had no writing and are known to us through Greek and Roman sources. They were a diverse collection of people who probably spoke similar languages and were not unified under a single leader. They also made and exchanged similar items characterised by the swirly, interlaced designs and stylised animals known as Celtic art. In the 1800s the notion of a shared Celtic past was crucial in shaping western European identities. 'Celtic' languages are still spoken in Wales, Ireland and Scotland.

	<b><a name="T4">29. Olmec stone mask </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
A stone face made by Olmecs, the first Central American culture to build cities and develop writing.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC
<br><br>
This Olmec mask was worn around the neck as a pendant. It may have provided the wearer with a new identity as an ancestor or deity - perhaps as the Olmec rain god. The distinctive toothless, down-turned mouth and infant-like face are typical of Olmec art. The ears are perforated and the mask may have originally been decorated with piercings. On either side of the mouth are two Olmec glyphs (picture signs). Olmec glyphs are the earliest known writing in America.
<br><br>
What is the legacy of the Olmecs?
<br><br>
The Olmecs are the earliest Central American civilisation and laid the foundations for subsequent societies. Features associated with the Mayans and Aztecs such as stepped-temples, the ceremonial ball game and complex astrological calendars all originated with the Olmecs. The apparent collapse of the Olmec civilisation is still not well understood. Their decline may have been caused by the overpopulation of the fragile tropical river valley environment, a volcanic eruption, or a shift in the flow of the area's rivers.

	<hr><br>
	
This Chinese bell plays different notes if hit in different places echoing the philosopher Confucius’ ideas of harmony.

<br><br>

This bronze bell is known as a bo. It is decorated with dragons swallowing geese and has a handle in the shape of two dragons. It required great skill to make a bo and bells of similar size were not made in the west until a thousand years later. This bo would have been part of a set of bells of different sizes each playing different notes. It is played with a hammer and plays two different notes depending on where it is struck.
<br><br>
How was harmony created through music in ancient China?
<br><br>
This bell was made at the beginning of the Warring States period - a time of political fragmentation and moral crisis in China. It was in this turmoil that the Chinese political philosopher Confucius developed his philosophy. Confucius had one overwhelming message: if we are to achieve a state of orderliness and peace, we need to return to traditional values of virtue. Confucius was also a keen musician and saw in music the harmony he wanted to achieve in society.

	<b><a name="T6">31. Coin with head of Alexander</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Coin showing Alexander the Great, issued by one of his successors.

<br><br>

This coin was issued by Lysimachus, the former general of Alexander the Great. After Alexander's death, Lysimachus ruled part of Alexander's empire in Bulgaria, northern Greece and Turkey known as 'Thrace'. Lysimachus used Alexander's portrait on his coins to emphasise his position as Alexander's successor. Alexander was worshipped as a god after his death. Here he sports the ram's horns of the god, Zeus Ammon, whom Egyptian priests claimed was Alexander's father. On the reverse of the coin is the goddess Athena.
<br><br>
Who was Alexander the Great?
<br><br>
Alexander was born in the kingdom of Macedon in 356 BC. By the age of 25 he had conquered Greece, Egypt and Persia, creating an empire spanning 2 million square miles. Following his death in 323 BC, Alexander's generals began to squabble over his legacy. Since they could not claim a blood-tie, these generals tried to legitimise their rule through other connections with Alexander. Eventually they divided the empire into three main kingdoms in Macedon, Egypt and Persia and went on to form powerful dynasties.

	<b><a name="T7">32. Pillar of Ashoka </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Inscription from a pillar erected by Ashoka, ruler of an Empire that covered most of the Indian subcontinent.

<br><br>

This fragment comes from one of the pillars erected throughout India by the Emperor Ashoka around 240 BC. The type of writing used for the inscription is known as 'Brahmi' and forms the basis for all later Indian, Tibetan and South-East Asian writing. This inscription outlines Ashoka's personal philosophy, a system similar to Buddhism, on how people should live their lives. In this pillar, Ashoka speaks of how the greatest conquest is over one's personal morals, not over other people or lands.
<br><br>
Who was Ashoka?
<br><br>
Ashoka was the most famous king of the Mauryan Empire, one of the largest empires in the history of South Asia. At their height, the Mauryans controlled most of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. As a young man Ashoka was renowned for his hedonism and cruelty. However, later in life he felt intense remorse triggered by a massacre that occurred during one of his conquests. This inspired him to renounce violence and follow dharma, a self-defined path of righteousness that guided him through life.

Ancient Egyptian stela with text in Greek, hieroglyphs and demotic, which allowed modern scholars to read hieroglyphs.

<br><br>

The Rosetta Stone is one of the most famous objects in the British Museum but the actual contents of its inscription is less well-known. The inscription is a decree that affirms the royal cult of the 13-year-old Ptolemy V on the first anniversary of his coronation in 196 BC. The same inscription is written in three different scripts, Greek, hieroglyphs and demotic Egyptian. It was this Greek inscription that allowed modern scholars to begin to decipher hieroglyphs for the first time.
<br><br>
Why is the Rosetta Stone written in three different scripts?
<br><br>
In 332 BC, Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great. After Alexander's death, his former general Ptolemy I ruled Egypt. His Greek descendents known as the Ptolemies ruled Egypt for the next 300 years. The Ptolemaic period witnessed a fusion of Greek and Egyptian cultures. Greek was the official language of the court, while hieroglyphs were limited to use by the priests. Demotic Egyptian was the native script used for everyday purposes.

	<hr><br>
	
Lacquer cup made on the orders of the Chinese Han dynasty emperor who ruled an empire to rival Rome in wealth and size.
<br><br>


Lacquer cups, like this one, were sometimes given by the emperor to an official as a gift or in lieu of salary. An inscription on the bottom lists the six artisans that made the cup and the seven product inspectors who guaranteed its quality. Lacquer objects were expensive, this cup is said to be worth 10 bronze cups. Lacquer objects were valued because they were time consuming to create. Lacquer is obtained from tree sap and a cup may require over six coats.
<br><br>
Who were the Han Dynasty?
<br><br>
China rivalled the Roman Empire in terms of wealth and size under the reign of the Han dynasty (221 BC C AD 220). The Han established a central government and an efficient civil service. Applicants were tested on their knowledge of the teachings of Confucius. The state strictly controlled prices and merchants were not allowed to own land, become officials or even wear silk. However, the Silk Road allowed Chinese merchants to trade silk and other products as far as the Roman Empire.

Head of Augustus, the first Roman emperor, originally part of a statue in Egypt that was decapitated and buried in Sudan.
<br><br>

<a href= "pic09.html">35. Head of Augustus</a><br><br>

This head of the emperor Augustus was originally part of a statue in Egypt. The Romans used statues to remind the empire's largely illiterate population of the power of the emperor. Augustus is always depicted as a youth to reflect his strength and vitality. 
<br><br>
This head was decapitated by an invading army from Meroe in modern-day Sudan. They buried the head under the temple steps as an insult to Augustus. Ironically, it was this act of defiance that preserved the head.
<br><br>

When did Rome become an empire?
<br><br>
Augustus was the first emperor of Rome. He transformed Rome from a republic, led by competing nobles, to an empire, ruled by one man. In 31 BC Augustus defeated the armies of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra and made Egypt a part of the empire. Egypt's immense wealth helped Augustus to develop an effective army to expand and protect the empire's borders. The Roman Empire enjoyed a period of long-lasting peace under Augustus' reign. When he died he was declared a god by the Roman Senate.

Silver cup used at Roman dinner parties decorated with pairs of male lovers, scenes not uncommon in Ancient Rome.

<br><br>

This luxurious silver cup was used at Roman dinner parties. The cup originally had two handles and depicts two pairs of male lovers. One side shows two teenage boys making love, while the other shows a young man lowering himself onto the lap of his elder, bearded lover. A slave-boy peers in voyeuristically from behind a door. The luxurious fabrics and musical instruments indicate that these scenes are set in a world heavily influenced by Greek culture, which the Romans admired and largely adopted.
<br><br>
What was the Roman attitude to relationships between men?
<br><br>
Images like this were not unusual in the Roman world. Some of the boys on this cup are underage by today's standards, but the Romans tolerated relationships between older and younger men. Relationships between men were part of Greek and Roman culture, from slaves to emperors, most famously the emperor Hadrian and his Greek lover, Antinous. Today such ancient images remind us that the way societies view sexuality is never fixed.

	<hr><br>
	
Pipe for ritual tobacco-smoking made by Native American farmers living in what is today the US state of Ohio.
<br><br>


The bowl for the tobacco in this pipe is in the top of the otter's head, and there is a small hole at one end to breathe in the smoke. The pipe was made by Native Americans living in what is today the US state of Ohio. These Native Americans were small-scale farmers who built large burial and ceremonial mounds. This pipe was buried with 200 other pipes in a collection of mounds known as the 'Mound City Group'.
<br><br>
What was the pipe used for?
<br><br>
This pipe was not simply smoked for pleasure but probably had a religious function. A shaman may have smoked it to evoke the otter as a representative of his clan, or as a spirit guide who would then accompany the shaman on a spiritual journey. Tobacco has been smoked in North America for at least 2300 years and pipe smoking still remains an integral part of modern Native American culture. Tobacco was first brought to Europe in the early 1500s, where it quickly spread across Europe, Africa and Asia.

Stone version of a belt worn by players of a ball game, a popular sport in Mexico and Central America.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC
<br><br>
This is a stone version of the type of belt worn by players of the Mesoamerican ballgame. It would have been too heavy to wear and was probably used during ritual ceremonies associated with the game. The ballgame was a team sport that resembled volley ball but without a net. The rubber balls were quite heavy and typically weighed three to four kilograms. Players had to keep the ball in the air using only their hips protected by padded leather belts.
<br><br>
Why was the ballgame played?
<br><br>
The ballgame has been played throughout Mexico and Central America for at least 3500 years. Games were contested on specially prepared ball courts, as part of political and religious ceremonies. The outcome of a match might help decide political and territorial disputes and occasionally the losers could be sacrificed to the gods. Ball courts were closely associated with death in Mesoamerican mythology and this belt is carved with the features of a Cane Toad, a symbol of the underworld.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Chinese scroll with advice for palace ladies on correct behaviour, a masterpiece of Chinese painting.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC
<br><br>
The Admonitions Scroll is one of the most important paintings in the world. It was originally painted by Gu Kaizhi (about AD 345C406), considered to be the father of classical Chinese figure painting. The original painting is now lost, but is known through this close copy made over 200 years later. Throughout history, Chinese artists have sought to emulate Gu Kaizhi's 'gossamer brush line'. This scroll bears the red seals of Chinese emperors and private collectors who once owned the painting.
<br><br>
What is happening in the scroll?
<br><br>
The scroll's full title, Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies, indicates the work's moralising tone. The scroll's protagonist is the court instructress who advises the ladies of the palace on correct behaviour. The poem was originally written around AD 290 to reprimand Empress Jia. She used her influence to manipulate the emperor and murder rivals, during an unstable time in Chinese history known as the Period of Disunion. She ignored the poem's advice, however, and was ultimately forced to commit suicide in a coup in AD 300.

	<hr><br>
	
Silver pot from a Roman treasure hoard, found in England. The pepper it contained came from India.

<br><br>

The holes in the bottom of this model of a Roman noble woman indicate that she was used as a pepper pot. She is part of the Hoxne hoard, the largest Roman treasure ever discovered in Britain. As well as three other pepper pots, the hoard contains around 15,234 coins and 200 gold objects. Only a very wealthy family could have owned such treasures. We do not know the identity of the person who buried it but several objects are inscribed with the name Aurelius Ursicinus.
<br><br>
How did pepper come to Britain?
<br><br>
Pepper did not grow in Britain or any other part of the Roman Empire. It was grown in India and to get to Suffolk, the pepper was first shipped to Egypt and then transported by sea, river and over land. Pepper was just one expensive luxury traded across the Indian Ocean in ancient times. Other items to reach the Roman World included gems, cloth and spices such as cloves, cinnamon and ginger. Along these trading routes also travelled monks, priests and diplomats linking Europe with India and China.<br><br>

One of the earliest images of the Buddha, seated and in an enlightened state, his posture shows he is teaching.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC<br><br>

This is one the first images of the Buddha ever created. It shows him in an enlightened state, wearing monk's robes and seated in the lotus position. The position of his hands indicates that he is revealing the dharma, the 'way' of his teaching. This statue would have sat in front of a stupa - a domed structure that enclosed the Buddha's ashes. Pilgrims used statues like this to contemplate the Buddha's teachings before they visited his relics.
<br><br>
When were the first images of the Buddha created?
<br><br>
Images of the Buddha were not created until over 500 years after his death. The Buddha was an Indian prince who lived around 400 BC. He became a Buddha - an 'Enlightened One' - through comprehending the roots of human suffering while living an ascetic life. Buddhism spread from India along the Silk Road and by sea, but it was not until AD 0 - 100 that the first images of the Buddha were created. Before that the Buddha was represented by symbols such as his footprints.

	<hr><br>
	
Coin from the Gupta Empire, showing a goddess and horse, marking the transition to Hinduism in India.
<br><br>


This coin was created to commemorate the Gupta horse-sacrifice or asvamedha. During this ritual a stallion was released to roam for a year. The royal court followed the wandering stallion and prevented him from mating. At the end of the year the sexually-frustrated horse was looked after by the royal women, before being sacrificed by the king using a golden dagger. King Kumaragupta I is said to have completed this ritual twice in his lifetime.
<br><br>
When did Hinduism first develop in India?
<br><br>
The Gupta Empire dominated the Indian subcontinent from about AD 320 to 550. During this period the old Vedic rituals like the asvamedha began to die out. They were replaced by a templebased religion that we would recognise today as Hinduism. As well as a belief in reincarnation, karma and the caste system, Hinduism saw the old Vedic gods merge with an array of popular and native gods. The goddess Sri-Lakshmi on this coin became the consort of the supreme Hindu god Vishnu.

	<hr><br>
	
A plate showing Sasanian King Shapur II, who ruled Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, and fought the Roman Empire.

<br><br>

This plate depicts a Sasanian king, probably Shapur II, leaping onto a stag and stabbing it in its neck. Sasanian kings were frequently portrayed as hunter-warriors, protecting their subjects from wild animals that ate their livestock or crops. Shapur II fought two long wars against the Roman Empire and, after killing the Roman emperor Julian, forced them to make peace with him. Shapur II also rigorously promoted Zoroastrianism, during the same period Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire.
<br><br>
Who were the Sasanians?
<br><br>
The Sasanians came from Iran and ruled a large empire from Iraq to Afghanistan from AD 224 to 622. They were the first Iranian dynasty to promote Zoroastrianism as the state religion. Zoroastrianism is the earliest religion to be based on a set of scriptures ? the teachings of the Prophet Zoroaster or Zarathustra. The conflict between man and animal on this plate may reflect the struggle between good and evil that lies at the heart of Zoroastrianism.

	<b><a name="T19">44. Hinton St Mary Mosaic </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
A mosaic floor from Roman Britain showing one of the oldest surviving depictions of Jesus Christ.
<br><br>


This mosaic is probably one of the oldest surviving depictions of Christ. It comes from a Roman villa in Dorset. Christ is portrayed as a fair-haired and clean-shaven man wearing a tunic and cloak. Behind his head are the letters chi (X) and rho (P), the first two letters of the Greek word for Christ - Christos. Christ's head is a part of a larger mosaic, also containing pagan elements. These include the Greek hero Bellerophon riding Pegasus and slaying the monstrous Chimera.
<br><br>
When did the Roman Empire become Christian?
<br><br>
In AD 312 the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and the religion began to spread freely throughout the Roman Empire. Britain was at that point a far-flung province of the empire that would be abandoned 100 years later. This mosaic may have come from a villa's dining room or house-church owned by one of Britain's long-established Roman aristocratic families. Combining Christian and pagan imagery was common in this period and Bellerophon slaying the monster may represent Christ's triumph over death and evil.

	<b><a name="T20">45. Arabian bronze hand</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Bronze hand given as an offering in a temple in pre-Islamic Yemen - a symbol of good luck, offered in exchange for well-being.
<br><br>


This bronze hand was given as an offering to the god Talab Riyam in a temple in pre-Islamic Yemen. The right hand was traditionally a symbol of good luck and an inscription on the hand indicates it was offered in exchange for well-being. Parts of the hand are very realistic and it may have been modeled on the man who dedicated it, Wahab Talab. The fact that Wahab shares a name with the god suggests he was a person of important status.
<br><br>
What was Arabia like before Islam?
<br><br>
Before the arrival of Islam in AD 622, Arabia was ruled by a confederation of tribes known as the Himyarites. They dominated the trade route between the Roman Empire and India and grew rich on the export of the 'perfumes of Arabia' - frankincense and myrrh. When this hand was made paganism was already declining due to the popularity of Judaism and Christianity. Islam largely purged Arabia of its pagan past and objects like this are all that remain of this lost religion.

	<b><a name="T21">46. Gold coin of Abd al-Malik </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Early Islamic coin, one of the first to show text from the Qur’an rather than use an image of the ruler.
<br><br>


This coin represents a defining point in Islamic history: when images of leaders on coins were replaced by text from the Qu'ran. The first coins issued by Caliph Abd al-Malik showed the figure of a ruler. This followed earlier traditions when pictorial images appeared on coins. He later removed the ruler's image and used only texts from the Qu'ran. Replacing images of rulers with Qu'ranic verses emphasised that the Islamic Empire was ruled by God and not by mortal men.
<br><br>
Who was Caliph Abd al-Malik?<br><br>

The ninth caliph, Abd al-Malik issued this coin. As caliph he was both the religious and political leader of the early Islamic Empire. He consolidated a string of conquests, which included half of the early Christian world and the former Persian Empire. This new Islamic Empire became a model for Islamic states for over 1000 years. One of his many reforms was the creation of a successful Islamic coinage. He is arguably the most important early Muslim leader after the Prophet Muhammad.

	<b><a name="T22">47. Sutton Hoo helmet</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Helmet found in the grave of an Anglo-Saxon warrior king.It is one of the most iconic Anglo-Saxon finds.
<br><br>


The Sutton Hoo Helmet is one of the most important Anglo Saxon finds of all time. It was buried in the grave of a warrior chieftain. Alongside it were a vast array of weaponry and a 27-metre-long ship. Although the helmet belonged to a powerful war-leader we cannot be certain who was buried at Sutton Hoo. When it was found it conjured up images of the warrior culture of the great Anglo Saxon epic poem, Beowulf that was written at a similar period.
<br><br>
What does Sutton Hoo tell us about the Anglo Saxon world?
<br><br>
The discovery of the Sutton Hoo burial in 1939 profoundly changed opinions of an era long dismissed as the dark ages. This was a period when some of the North Sea states - England, France, Norway, Denmark and Sweden were first coming into existence. The tomb contained hanging bowls from the Celtic West, gold coins from mainland Europe and silver tableware from the eastern Mediterranean. The Anglo Saxon world was connected through a complex trade network and gifts were often exchanged among the highest tiers of society.

	<hr><br>
	
Kneeling warrior pot made by the Moche, one of the first South American cultures to develop a state structure.
<br><br>
Listen to this programme on the BBC
<br><br>
This pot was made in Peru by the Moche. It shows a kneeling Moche warrior holding a club in one hand and a shield in the other. Warfare, warriors and prisoners are a recurring theme in Moche art. They testify to the violent, inter-valley rivalries that frequently occurred over agricultural land. Skeletal evidence reveals injuries sustained by blows from clubs as part of active war service. The pots themselves seem to have served as symbolic tomb guardians, as they are frequently found in high-status burialS.
<br><br>
Who were the Moche?
<br><br>
The Moche were one of the first South American cultures to develop a state structure. Peru's coastline provided them with a rich and nutritious diet that was able to support a dense population. The Moche were skilled builders, constructing irrigation canals, pyramids and palaces. They also mass-produced hundreds of pots, like this one, depicting the different ranks of Moche society. The Moche kingdom came to an end as a result of climatic changes and drought.

	<hr><br>
	
Roof tile intended to scare evil spirits from a house in the magnificent ancient Korean capital city of Kyongju.
<br><br>


The face on this roof tile glares at the viewer. It was intended to scare away evil spirits from a building in the magnificent ancient capital city of Kyongju. Similar tiles were used earlier in China, but once introduced into the Korean peninsula, they reached a new height in popularity and artistry. This face most closely resembles that of a dragon, animals associated with water and hence appropriate as guardians to place on a wooden building always in danger of fire.
<br><br>
What was Korea's grandest city in ancient times?
<br><br>
This tile is from Kyongju, the capital of the Unified Silla dynasty of Korea. The city was famous for its wide streets laid out in a grid. All the houses, palaces and Buddhist temples had tiled roofs, a sign of wealth and sophistication. Decorated roof tiles started to become widespread around AD 688, when the small Korean kingdom of Silla, with help from China, conquered two other Korean kingdoms. This ushered in an age of prosperity and cultural unity in the Korean peninsula.

	<b><a name="T25">50. Silk princess painting </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Painting from central Asia showing the legend of a princess who smuggled the secret of how to make silk out of China.
<br><br>


This painting on a wooden panel shows scenes from the Central Asian story of the Silk Princess. According to this legend, a Chinese princess smuggled the secret of how to make silk out of China and into the country of her new husband, the king of Khotan. As she was a princess the border guards did not dare search her. In this painting her elaborate headdress conceals the cocoons of the silk moth and the seeds of the mulberry tree.
<br><br>
What was the Silk Road?
<br><br>
The painting comes from a Buddhist shrine in Khotan in Central Asia. This was just one of many oasis cities along the Silk Road. Silk and other goods were traded along this route from China to India, western Asia and the Mediterranean. Monks, merchants and other Silk Road travellers, stimulated the spread of Buddhism from India to China, Korea and Japan and many Buddhist monasteries and shrines were created along the route.
